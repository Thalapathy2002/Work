Adding domain in Informatica Tool
Firstly  we need to change the properties of host to full control by going to 
C drive-> drive -> windows ->System 32 -> drivers -> etc ->hosts
Open properties of hosts->Security->enable write permission

Open hosts file and add server which you want to use 
# the server you dont want to use->Save the changes .

#112.196.62.19 win-q1q79rd01rd
172.18.20.3 win-q1q79rd01rd

Open the informatica tool 
File->Connect to repository->configure domain->Add->add the host name (here it is q1q79rd01rd)->Test connection

Username - INT 324
Password - 123

Creating a PDO                                     (here we would have a option of either dragging the data inside the file or get only a empty one)


Right click on Physical Data Object -> New PDO -> Browse dataset ->next->Finish(include 1st row as)
