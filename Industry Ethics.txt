Topic: Machine Learning-based Pest Count Forecasting for Solar Insecticidal Lamps


Abstract:
Agricultural pests severely threaten food security, resulting in significant economic, social, and environmental impacts. This paper uses weather data and machine learning models to forecast pest counts. Data from solar insecticidal lamps, including pest counts and meteorological conditions, were collected. Using this data, we developed a multidimensional forecasting model. The model integrates crucial variables, including pest counts, temperature, humidity, and geographical coordinates. The genetic algorithm back propagation neural network model has demonstrated excellent performance in forecasting pest numbers, with an R2 value of 0.73, confirming its effectiveness in the early detection of crop diseases and pest infestations. Moreover, this high-accuracy forecasting model provides a scientific basis for intelligently adjusting the insecticidal working time of solar insecticidal lamps, thereby enhancing pest control efficiency and energy utilization. This research not only reinforces the application of machine learning in agricultural pest management but also provides significant support for precision agriculture.

SECTION I.Introduction
Currently, chemical pesticides are effective in controlling pests but they also have significant drawbacks [1]. They can cause environmental pollution, food safety risks and evolutionary changes in pest populations [2]. Solar insecticide lamps (SIL) have been developed to address these challenges as a new type of agricultural plant protection device [3]. These devices exploit the phototactic behavior of pests, using light sources to attract flying pests and execute effective pest control by releasing high-voltage pulses upon contact with an internal high-voltage metal mesh [4]. To enhance the efficacy and management convenience of these lamps in agricultural applications, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been integrated into the devices. As illustrated in Figure 1, these IoT components enable the SIL to monitor real-time weather conditions, energy consumption, and the number of pests killed, transmitting this data to servers and edge computing nodes in real time [5].

Most researchers [6], [7] typically use traps and survey SILs for data collection and employ artificial intelligence algorithms such as machine learning to model and predict pest data historically. Previous studies [8]–​[10] often categorize pest occurrences into various warning levels for forecasting. However, research on using data to predict pest occurrences within specific periods remains scarce. To build a more accurate pest count forecasting model, we utilize data collected by the SILs in the fields to predict pest occurrences within hourly time frames. By integrating SIL historical data with weather information, the system can autonomously adjust its insecticidal working time based on predicted pest numbers, thereby enhancing pest control effectiveness. The application of this method provides a more efficient and sustainable solution for pest management. The development of this technology marks a significant advancement in agricultural pest control methods, showcasing the potential application of artificial intelligence in addressing traditional agricultural issues.

The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

To enhance the robustness of the forecasting model, this study delved into and analyzed pest data from Dayi County, Chengdu, China, integrating it with meteorological data.

This paper innovatively applies a variety of machine learning techniques, including support vector machines, decision tees, traditional back propagation (BP) neural networks, and their genetic algorithm optimized variants (GA-BP networks).

This study developed a short-term hourly pest activity forecasting model capable of real-time, precise pest count forecasting.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II presents the related works. The data and methods are provided In Section III. Section IV presents the simulation results and analysis. Finally, Section V describes the conclusions and future works of this research.

SECTION II.Related Works
The pest occurrence is primarily influenced by the interaction between biological and abiotic factors [9]. Among them, non-biological factors are mainly driven by climate factors, such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity. These factors directly affect the life cycle and growth rate of pests [11]. For instance, rainfall during the dry season, misalignment of different crop planting times, and unstable climate conditions can all stimulate the invasive behavior of pests. Given that meteorological conditions significantly impact the number and growth rate of pests, it is of great significance to forecast the number of pests by monitoring their living environment conditions. This helps optimize the insecticidal working time of SILs for timely pest control measures and improves the accuracy of pest forecasts.

In precision agriculture, machine learning technologies have been widely applied to pest forecasts, aiming to better understand the relationship between meteorological factors and pest outbreaks. In [6], the author utilized meteorological and pest data from Chongqing’s Fuling District from 2012 to 2016 and applied a BP neural network model to explore the impact of climate factors on pest data. The results indicated that climate factors had a significant impact on pest outbreaks. Furthermore, Lucas Eduardo et al., [7] used K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models to predict the probability of pest occurrence in coffee plantations in the Minas Gerais region of Brazil, considering weather conditions. They developed a pest and disease warning system, achieving a best mean square error of 0.2606, significantly improving the accuracy of pest count forecasting. To further enhance the performance of the forecasting models, Latif et al., [8] utilized IoT technology to monitor temperature, humidity, and precipitation within rice crops and employed a feedforward neural network model for predicting pest outbreaks. Concurrently, Saleem [9] leveraged historical data to conduct weekly predictions of whiteflies in cotton fields using machine learning techniques, further demonstrating the potential of machine learning in pest count forecasting. Lastly, in [10], based on data from Southern and Southwestern China from 2000 to 2019, the effectiveness of Graph Convolutional Networks and Long Short-Term Memory network models in predicting the population of rice planthoppers was evaluated. Table I summarizes the research efforts that mainly focus on predicting pest levels. After obtaining datasets, researchers categorized pest number data into different pest occurrence levels. They transformed the problem into a multi-class classification problem, to predict pest occurrence levels in different regions to achieve effective agricultural pest control.

SECTION III.Data and methods
A. Dataset description
• Dataset source
This study employs data from six SIL nodes located in Dayi County, Chengdu, China. The primary crops in Dayi County are rice and corn, with major pests including the Chilo suppressalis and Ostrinia nubilalis. The data collection period spans from June 2022 to November 2022. Measurements were recorded every 3 minutes, and the initial characteristics and definitions of the dataset are detailed in Table II. The historical data of five nodes are selected as the training set, and the data of the last node are used as the test set. This data set provides a substantial resource for conducting comprehensive data analysis and model development within this study.

• Data Preprocessing
This section focuses on data preprocessing. Initially, anomaly detection is performed to identify and remove outliers, such as data points with temperatures of 90°C or humidity values of 0%. Pearson correlation heatmap is utilized to eliminate irrelevant fields, including device connection status and charging status flag, as their constant values across the dataset provide no analytical value. Analyzing the correlations among these factors reveals their potential associations with pest counts. Based on these significantly correlated features, appropriate feature selection can be performed, reducing data complexity while enhancing the model’s emphasis on key features. For the time-related fields, data that accurately reflect real-world conditions are selected to ensure the correctness of time labels. Finally, data non-uniformity is addressed by consolidating data within the same region. Data fusion, filling, and interpolation techniques handle missing data by maintaining data continuity. To better apply pest forecasting to the insecticidal time control of SIL, the original minute-level data are aggregated into hourly data. This approach effectively addresses issues of data non-uniformity and lays a solid foundation for subsequent data analysis and model development. Ultimately, the selected input parameters for pest count forecasting include temperature, relative humidity, solar panel voltage, high-voltage metal mesh voltage, and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), as presented in Table II.

B. Model introduction
The BP neural network is a widely used artificial neural network model that trains based on forward and backward propagation algorithms. It is a multi-layer feed-forward neural network extensively applied in classification, regression, and pattern recognition tasks. The core principle of BP neural networks lies in continuously adjusting the network’s weights and biases to minimize the error between predicted and actual values.

BP neural network typically consist of three main components: input layer, hidden layer, and output layer.

The input layer receives pest control data from SIL devices and weather data, with each neuron representing a specific input feature. The hidden layer processes the input data using nonlinear activation functions and generally contains one or more layers. The number of neurons in the hidden layer must be determined experimentally. While increasing the number of hidden layers and neurons can enhance the network’s fitting capability, it may also lead to overfitting. The output layer generates the predicted results for pest counts. Although BP neural networks offer broad applicability and strong nonlinear fitting capabilities, they have several limitations, including slow training speeds, susceptibility to local optima, and a tendency to overfit.

To address these limitations and further enhance the forecasting accuracy and convergence speed of BP neural networks, The genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced to optimize the initial weights and biases. The weights and biases optimized by GA are closer to the global optimum, accelerating the training process’s convergence and significantly improving the model’s performance. The arithmetic process of the GA-BP algorithm is as follows:

Initialization phase: Randomly generate N individuals, where each individual represents a BP neural network’s parameters (including weights and biases). Each individual is encoded as a vector of length L, which uses floating-point numbers to represent all weights and biases.

Genetic algorithm optimization phase: 1) For each individual, initialize a BP neural network using the corresponding weights and biases. Perform forward propagation on the training data, and compute the loss. 2) Use a roulette wheel selection method or tournament selection to choose individuals with higher fitness values as parents for the next generation. 3) Perform crossover operations on the selected parents to generate offspring. 4)Apply mutation to the offspring with a probability, introducing random perturbations to specific genes in the vector. 5) Replace the least fit individuals in the current population with the newly generated offspring to update the population. 6) Repeat the above steps for a predefined number of iterations and select the best individual based on the highest fitness value.

BP neural network training phase: 1) Use the best individual from the genetic algorithm, which has the highest fitness value, to initialize the weights and biases of the BP neural network. 2) Perform forward propagation on the training data to calculate the activation values for each layer of neurons. 3) Use a loss function to calculate the forecasting error. 4) Compute the gradient of the loss function concerning the weights and biases and update the parameters. 5) Iterate the forward propagation and parameter update process until convergence. Finally, output the model parameters with the highest forecasting accuracy.

SECTION IV.Experimental results
This section primarily covers performance metrics and comparisons. The paper provides a detailed presentation of experimental simulation indicators and comparisons between different algorithms, offering a concise and accurate description of the results, including interpretations of the findings and conclusions drawn from the experiments. Standardized performance metrics are used in this study to assess the performance of the mathematical model in terms of reliability and stability. These include correlation coefficient (R-squared, R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean bias error (MBE). When the R2 value is close to 1 and the error indicator decreases, it indicates that the stability and accuracy of the mathematical model is high. These quantitative metrics provide an objective evaluation of the model’s performance, thus ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the mathematical model in pest management.

Figure 2 illustrates scatter plots of the actual versus predicted values for four different models during training, representing decisiontrees, SVM, BP neural networks, and GA-BP neural networks respectively. Figure 2 (a) depicts the scatter plot for the Decision Tree model, where the data points are widely dispersed away from the ideal diagonal line, indicating significant deviation in the forecasting within the training set, particularly in areas with high values. Figure 2 (b) shows the scatter plot for the SVM model, which are distributed above and below the diagonal, indicating biases in specific instances; however, most points are densely clustered at lower values, suggesting decent accuracy within a limited range. Figure 2 (c) for the BP neural network shows data points are relatively dense and mostly close to the diagonal, indicating good predictive accuracy on the training set. Figure 2 (d) displays the scatter plot for the GA-BP neural network, which exhibits the tightest clustering along the diagonal, suggesting an excellent fit between the predicted and actual values. The data points are uniformly distributed across the diagonal. Deviations at higher values are notably reduced. This result demonstrates the enhanced predictive capability achieved through GA optimization.

Figure 3 illustrates the trends of actual versus predicted values for four models during testing: decision trees, SVM, BP neural networks, and GA-BP neural networks. Figure 3 (a) shows that although the Decision Tree model generally follows the trend of actual values, it exhibits large deviations at peak values, resulting in a high overall RMSE, indicating that its sensitivity to noisy data may lead to unstable forecasting. Figure 3 (b) reveals that SVM forecasting largely track the actual value trend, but experience significant biases in high peak areas, and a high RMSE, suggesting limitations in handling high-volatility data. Figure 3 (c) displays that BP neural network forecasting closely follow the fluctuations of actual values with smaller deviations, boasting a significantly lower RMSE, demonstrating better capability in capturing data patterns. Figure 3 (d) indicates that the GA-BP neural network achieves the highest fidelity between predicted and actual values, with significantly reduced deviations in high-value areas, showing that GA optimization substantially enhances the model’s predictive accuracy.

As shown in Table III, the GA-BP neural network exhibits the best performance across all evaluation metrics, achieving the lowest error values (RMSE and MAE) and the highest goodness of fit (R2). This indicates that the GA-BP neural net work offers superior forecasting accuracy and model stability. The standard BP neural network ranks second, demonstrating reasonable performance, though it lacks the effectiveness of the GA-BP neural network. The SVM model shows moderate performance, with forecasting error and fit that surpass those of the decision tree but fall short of the BP neural network. The decision tree, on the other hand, performs the worst, with the highest forecasting errors (RMSE and MAE), the largest bias (MBE), and the lowest fit (R2), suggesting it may be unsuitable for this pest count forecasting task.

Testing Performance Metrics for Different Machine Learning Models
The evaluation results on the test set indicate that the GA-BP neural network performs best among the four algorithms, as depicted in Table IV. It exhibits the lowest forecasting errors (RMSE of 31.63, MAE of 9.76) and the highest goodness of fit (R2 of 0.73), demonstrating superior forecasting accuracy and model stability compared to other models. The standard BP neural network follows closely, showing reasonable predictive capability (RMSE of 36.23, MAE of 10.26, R2 of 0.65) despite lacking optimization. The SVM model demonstrates moderate performance, surpassing the decision tree but slightly inferior to the BP neural network. With an RMSE of 38.95, MAE of 11.39, and R2 of 0.59, it achieves moderate forecasting accuracy and fit. The decision tree performs the worst, with the highest forecasting errors.

In summary, the GA-BP neural network outperforms the other algorithms across all evaluation metrics and is the optimal choice for pest count forecasting tasks.

SECTION V.Conclusion and future work
In this study, the four machine learning models were evaluated—decision trees, SVM, BP neural network, and GA-BP—for their effectiveness in forecasting pest counts in SIL in Dayi County, Chengdu, China. The performance of these models was compared on a test dataset, where the GA-BP neural network demonstrated superior performance across all metrics, achieving an R2 value of 0.73. This research not only highlights the exceptional predictive capabilities of the GA-BP neural network for pest count forecasting but also underscores the potential of machine learning technologies in agricultural pest management.

In the future, the more extensive dataset, including pest data from various regions, will be introduced to enhance the adaptability and prediction accuracy of the models. Additionally, exploration of a wider variety of machine learning models is planned, along with the integration of real-world data testing to further improve the generalizability and accuracy of the models. By integrating the prediction models with the SIL, real-time prediction and management of pest behavior will be achieved. This strategy will enhance the precision and effectiveness of agricultural pest control.

1. Introduction
UAVs, often known as unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), are becoming increasingly popular and are employed in various applications. It is extensively utilized for many different uses, including photogrammetry, surveying, mapping, crop spraying & monitoring, agriculture, disaster monitoring, military applications, and so on [1]. Details regarding UAV can be found in Valavanis et al. [2]. Controlled aerial vehicles, or UAVs, perform various tasks without human intervention and can be controlled remotely using multiple electronic devices, including sensors and microprocessors [3]. In such situations where human intervention is risky, UAVs can operate independently [4]. UAV has various applications in many sectors [5], [6]. Although UAVs are applied in many different sectors, some of the most common uses are in agriculture [7], the military and defense [8], 3D mapping [9], construction and infrastructure [10], and forestry [11]. UAVs can potentially transform various applications and industries and offer several advantages. However, similar to any technology, UAVs have some difficulties [12], [13]. Despite several challenges, it is anticipated to find application in numerous fields, including transportation management, pollution monitoring, civic security, and delivery of goods in urban areas in the future [14].
UAVs are essential for transforming farming methods. With their advanced sensors and cameras, farmers provide useful information for yield optimization, crop monitoring, and precision agriculture [15]. UAVs provide an economical and effective way to collect data and conduct aerial imagery, allowing farmers to maximize crop production and make informed decisions [16]. UAVs have become essential instruments in contemporary agriculture, especially in the field of plant disease diagnosis [17]. Traditional disease monitoring techniques have been revolutionized by UAVs, which integrate sophisticated sensors and imaging technologies to enable practical airborne observation and data collection. Through early disease diagnosis, targeted interventions, and increased agricultural output and sustainability, this strategy provides farmers with immediate and comprehensive insights into crop health [18]. Beyond identifying diseases and weeds, UAVs are being used more and more in pest management to provide real-time information on the extent of pest infestations across vast fields [19]. Drones can identify regions that are prone to pests and evaluate the efficacy of management methods by utilizing machine learning and advanced image technology. By facilitating prompt interventions, this precision technique lessens crop losses, promotes sustainable agriculture, and uses less pesticides—all of which further the objectives of precision agriculture. Agriculture has seen a significant increase in the use of UAVs for weed management. UAVs, which are outfitted with sophisticated sensors and imaging technologies, provide accurate and effective field surveillance of weed infestations, allowing farmers to perform focused interventions and reduce agricultural output [20]. This creative weed control strategy can potentially improve farm sustainability and productivity [21].
Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models are crucial for identifying weeds and plant diseases. To generate accurate predictions, they analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns [22]. By employing these methods, agricultural experts can identify and address plant issues early, resulting in healthier crops and better farming practices [23], [24]. K-Nearest Neighbours [25], Support Vector Machines [26], Convolutional Neural Networks [27], Random Forest [28], etc., are popular ML and DL algorithms used in plant disease and weed detection. These algorithms play a critical role in agriculture by protecting against weed infestation and crop diseases, thereby maintaining the integrity of agricultural ecology.
However, potential obstacles are associated with ML and DL algorithms in UAV-based plant disease detection, pest control and weed management, which require more research. A detailed analysis of ML and DL methodologies is essential for thoroughly understanding this emerging field. This analysis should cover algorithmic strategies, data preprocessing techniques, available datasets, diverse applications, associated obstacles, and future research directions. However, the existing literature addresses relevant topics, and a research gap exists, especially when considering a comprehensive approach, as indicated in Table 1. Thus, we conducted an in-depth review limited to the latest developments in machine learning and deep learning applications for UAV-based plant disease, pest control and weed detection. This review provides insightful information to stakeholders and researchers, assists in developing practical approaches, and provides an overview of the state of play in this rapidly growing field.

UAVs also play vital roles in weed management. Different types of UAVs with different sensors have been used for weed management. The model of the UAVs and their drone types are listed in Table 5. The description of each UAV model provides a brief introduction and a clear understanding. Some models were found in both plant disease detection and weed management and were excluded from this table. Instead, they have been included in the previous table.
3.2. Overview of sensors
In this section, we go into great detail about the sensors that the UAVs use for agricultural monitoring. It offers an in-depth analysis of several sensor types and their descriptions. It provides insights into their applications in drone technology for weed and plant disease identification, as summarized in Table 6, along with some case studies.
Table 6. Overview of sensors used in UAVs for plant disease detection and weed management.

Sensor	Description	Advantages	Disadvantages
RGB [64], [65]	RGB sensors detect and record red, green, and blue light using photodiodes or CCDs. Each hue's light intensity is measured and digitized into 8 bits per channel, yielding millions of color combinations. Image processing algorithms then create full-color photos for digital cameras, cellphones, and computer screens.	Simple design leads to lower production costs. Mimics human vision for accurate color representation.	Only captures three primary colors, lacking detailed spectral data. Less suitable for specialized applications that require multispectral or hyperspectral imaging.
Hyperspectral [66], [67], [68]	Hyperspectral sensors, which cover hundreds of tiny spectral bands from visible to infrared, make extensive spectrum analysis possible for applications like mineralogy, vegetation research, and environmental monitoring.	The high spectral resolution allows for precise material identification and characterization. Captures subtle differences between materials for advanced analysis.	High spectral resolution leads to more complex and expensive sensor systems. Typically has lower spatial resolution compared to some other imaging systems.
Multispectral [69], [70]	Multispectral sensors provide a compromise between hyperspectral complexity and RGB simplicity by capturing light across numerous unique wavelength bands beyond RGB. This wider spectral coverage improves the accuracy of data collection regarding the environment or the objects being examined.	Captures more bands than RGB for better differentiation between materials. More affordable than hyperspectral sensors while offering improved capabilities over RGB.	Captures fewer bands than hyperspectral sensors, reducing spectral detail. Requires specialized processing to interpret and analyze multiple spectral bands.
NIR [71]	Agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing all depend on NIR sensors, which are sensitive to light with a wavelength between 700 and 2500 nanometers. Precision farming, vegetation analysis, and land mapping are all enhanced by them.	NIR sensors are more sensitive than visible light sensors, allowing them to detect even the smallest variations in surface properties and material composition. NIR sensors are crucial for monitoring crops, woods, and other types of vegetation because they are extremely sensitive to changes in the health of the vegetation.	Because NIR sensors require specialized technology and components, they may be more expensive than visible-light sensors. NIR data analysis calls for specialized software and processing techniques, which could make processes more difficult.
Thermal [72], [73], [74]	Thermal sensors recognize heat signatures rather than visible light by detecting and measuring infrared radiation from objects. Their wavelength range of operation is long-wave infrared (LWIR), usually ranging from 8 to 14 micrometers. This allows them to display temperature differences between surfaces and objects.	Thermal sensors precisely measure surface temperatures, making it possible to identify hotspots, irregularities, or temperature variations. Thermal sensors can function well in total darkness or low light.	Compared to visible-light cameras, thermal sensors may have a reduced spatial resolution, making it more difficult for them to record small objects. As temperature variations may not always signal particular situations or flaws, interpreting thermal imagery requires unique training and understanding.
3.3. Drone types overview
An overview of several drone types used in agriculture, namely for plant disease diagnosis and weed management, is provided in this section. Table 7 describes each drone type's advantages and disadvantages. Some case studies have been conducted to understand the situation better. The description of each drone type provides a brief and clear introduction. Furthermore, case studies offer useful perspectives on their practical implementation, enhancing the comprehension of each drone type's efficacy in agricultural settings.
Table 7. Types of drones used and their summary.

Drone Type	Description	Advantages	Disadvantages
Quadcopter [75], [76]	Electric motor-driven quadcopters have four rotors that allow them to fly to 400 feet for recreational purposes or higher. Their gyroscopes and accelerometers provide stability, and their cameras can capture 4K video and high-resolution images.	Quadcopters are inherently stable owing to their four-rotor design, making them easier to fly and control than other drone types. Their agile design allows quadcopters to perform intricate maneuvers, making them suitable for capturing dynamic aerial shots and navigating tight spaces.	Quadcopters typically have a relatively short battery life, ranging from 15 to 30 minutes, which can limit the duration of flights and operations. Due to their design and size, quadcopters generally have a limited payload capacity compared with other types of drones, restricting the equipment or cargo they can carry.
Hexacopter [77], [78]	Compared with quadcopters, hexacopter drones have more stability and lifting capacity because they have six rotors. Because they can handle larger weights, they are ideal for professional filmmaking, specialized equipment transportation, and industrial inspections.	Hexacopters offer enhanced stability due to their six-rotor design, making them more resilient to wind gusts and external disturbances than quadcopters. With six rotors distributing their weight, hexacopters can carry heavier payloads, typically ranging from 3 to 6 kg, making them suitable for professional applications that require specialized equipment or cameras.	The six-rotor design of hexacopters can make them more complex to build, maintain, and repair than simpler quadcopters. Owing to their increased number of rotors and components, hexacopters tend to be more expensive than quadcopters, making them less accessible to hobbyists or budget-conscious users.
Octocopter [79], [80]	Octocopters are eight-rotor multirotor drones. Compared to quadcopters or hexacopters, they provide improved stability and lifting capacity. Advanced control and stability are provided by its design for professional applications.	With eight rotors, octocopters offer superior stability, making them capable of maintaining position more accurately under challenging conditions such as strong winds. Octocopters can carry heavier payloads ranging from 6 to 20 kg or more, allowing for the use of larger and more advanced equipment or sensors.	Owing to their additional rotors and complexity, octocopters are more expensive to purchase and maintain than quadcopters or hexacopters. With more rotors and motors, octocopters have a higher level of mechanical and electronic complexity, which can lead to more points of failure and require more advanced troubleshooting and maintenance skills.
Fixed-wing [81], [82]	With their wings for lift and forward propulsion, fixed-wing drones can travel at great speeds for extended periods of time. Their effective aerodynamic shape makes them excellent in mapping and monitoring wide areas.	Fixed-wing drones are more energy-efficient than multirotor drones, allowing for longer flight times and extended range with the same battery capacity. With their long flight times and high speeds, fixed-wing drones can cover large areas exceeding 100-200 square kilometers in a single flight, providing comprehensive data collection or surveillance capabilities.	Fixed-wing drones require a controlled landing approach, which can be challenging in windy conditions or on uneven terrain, potentially leading to damage or loss of the drone. Due to their high-speed flight and limited maneuverability, fixed-wing drones are less suitable for close inspection tasks that require hovering or slow, precise movements.

These metrics help researchers compare and assess various detection strategies by offering quantitative measurements of the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance characteristics. This section provides a thorough resource for assessing the efficacy of the detection models in automated agricultural monitoring systems. Table 21 summarizes the metric descriptions, formulas, and pertinent studies.
Table 21. Summary of evaluation metrices.

Metrics	Description	Formula	Studies
Kappa coefficient	Cohen's kappa coefficient, also known as just “kappa,” is a statistical metric that evaluates the degree of agreement between two raters or classifiers that goes above and beyond what would be predicted by chance. Assessing the agreement between two raters who might assign objects to more than one category is especially helpful. The range of Cohen's kappa coefficient is -1 to 1. It is frequently applied in many different domains, such as agreement assessment in social science or medical research, classification model evaluation, and inter-rater reliability studies.	
Kraemer et al. [158]
accuracy	The percentage of accurate predictions a model makes out of all the forecasts it makes is called its accuracy. The computation involves dividing the number of guesses by the number of correct forecasts. Although accuracy offers a straightforward and intuitive view of a model's performance, it might not be enough to evaluate performance when errors have differing degrees of significance or when datasets are imbalanced.	
Carvalho et al. [159]
precision	By dividing the number of true positives by the total of false positives and true positives, precision determines how accurate positive forecasts are. It illustrates the model's capacity to refrain from mistakenly classifying negative events as positive ones.	
Buckland et al. [160]
recall	The percentage of true positive predictions that are accurately identified out of all real positive instances is known as recall or sensitivity. The ratio of true positives to the total of true positives and false negatives is used to measure the model's capacity to identify positive occurrences.	
Tureckova et al. [161]
F1-score	The F1 score is a statistic that balances recall and precision by combining both into a single value. It is computed as the harmonic mean of recall and precision, where each metric is given equal weight. Better simultaneous performance in recall and precision is indicated by a higher F1 score.	
Dalianis et al. [162]
coefficients of determination (R2)	The percentage of the dependent variable's variation that can be anticipated from the independent variables in a regression model is expressed as the coefficient of determination. Higher numbers on a scale of 0 to 1 suggest a better match between the model and the data.	
Di et al. [163]
root mean square errors (RMSE)	In a regression problem, the average difference between the predicted and actual values is measured using the Root Mean Square Error statistic. The square root of the average of the squared deviations between the observed and expected values is computed. Better model performance is shown by lower RMSE values; zero denotes perfect forecast alignment.	
Hodson et al. [164]
mean average precision (mAP)	A typical statistic for assessing object detection and information retrieval systems is Mean Average Precision, or mAP. The mean of these average precision scores is then determined after calculating the average precision (AP) across various memory levels. A higher mAP indicates greater precision and recall across all classes or inquiries.	
Henderson et al. [165]
MAE	The average absolute difference between the anticipated and actual values in a regression issue is measured by the Mean Absolute Error or MAE. Lower MAE values suggest smaller prediction errors, which gives a clear indication of the model's performance.	
Willmott et al. [166]
MSE	In a regression issue, the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values is measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE). It offers a numerical evaluation of the model's accuracy; more prediction errors are indicated by higher MSE values.	
Wang et al. [167]
Sorensen-Dice Coefficient (DS)	Frequently employed in similarity metrics, the Sørensen-Dice coefficient calculates the degree of similarity between two sets by dividing the product of the sizes of the sets' intersections by two. It gives a number in the range of 0 to 1, where 0 denotes no overlap, and 1 denotes total overlap.	
Carass et al. [168]
Intersection over Union (IoU)	As the ratio of their intersection to their union, Intersection over Union is an evaluation metric that quantifies the overlap between expected and ground truth bounding boxes or segmentation masks.

8.1. Machine learning algorithms
Machine learning techniques are vital for the analysis and classification of data obtained from aerial imagery in the fields of plant disease and weed identification using UAV technology. Computational models are used to distinguish between plants that are disease-free, afflicted by diseases, or overtaken by weeds. They make it possible to accurately and efficiently identify and characterize plant health issues automatically by utilizing supervised learning and image processing techniques. This section examines many machine-learning approaches that are frequently used in agricultural monitoring, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, to detect weeds and diseases.
8.1.1. K-Nearest Neighbors
In machine learning, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a flexible and user-friendly technique that can be applied to both regression and classification problems [194]. The majority vote of a new data point's closest neighbors in the feature space determines its class label in the KNN classification. Similarly, the predicted value in the KNN regression is calculated as the mean of the values of its closest neighbors. Selecting the number of neighbors, k, is an important hyperparameter that affects the algorithm's performance. While a larger k value may result in smoother choice borders but may ignore local fluctuations in the data, a smaller k value leads to more flexible decision boundaries but may also result in more variance.
Mathematically, the predicted class 
 for x is calculated as:
where 
 is the Kronecker delta function that returns 1 if 
 (the class label of the i-th nearest neighbor) is equal to c (a class label), and 0 otherwise.
Similarly, in the KNN regression, the predicted value 
 for x is computed as:
where 
 is the value associated with the i-th nearest neighbor.
The choice of several neighbors, denoted by k, is a crucial hyperparameter significantly affecting the algorithm's performance. While a bigger k number may result in smoother decision boundaries, it may ignore local variations in the data. A smaller k value leads to more flexible decision boundaries and may result in more variance.
8.1.2. Support vector regression
Support vector regression (SVR) is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks [195]. This method involves creating a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space and fitting it to the data points to maximize the margin between them and the hyperplane. While fitting as many data points as possible within a given margin or threshold, SVR seeks to reduce prediction errors. The data points closest to the hyperplane, or support vectors, are used to create the ideal regression function. SVR can handle datasets with intricate interactions between input and output variables and is especially useful for nonlinear regression applications. The optimization problem for SVR can be formulated as:
Minimize: 
⁎
Subject to:
⁎
⁎
Here, w is the weight vector, b is the bias term, ϵ is the margin, C is the regularization parameter, 
 represents the feature mapping of input data point 
, and 
, 
⁎
 are slack variables. The objective is to minimize the norm of w while ensuring that the error between the predicted and actual values is within the specified margin ϵ for all data points. Data points that lie on the margin or violate the margin constraint are known as support vectors.
8.1.3. Random forest
A popular machine learning technique for both classification and regression applications is random forest [196]. During training, it builds several decision trees and outputs each tree's class or average forecast individually. A random subset of the training data and characteristics is used to train each tree, which helps enhance generalization and reduce overfitting. Random forests can easily handle high-dimensional datasets and are resilient to noisy inputs and outliers. It is useful for comprehending underlying data linkages because it offers insights into the importance of features.
8.1.4. Support vector machine (SVM)
The supervised learning algorithm, SVM, was employed to solve problems involving regression and classification. In a high-dimensional feature space, it determines the ideal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes. By utilizing various kernel functions, SVM can handle both linear and nonlinear data and is resistant to overfitting [197]. The goal is to maximize the margin—also referred to as support vectors—between the decision boundary and nearest data points. The regularization parameter and kernel function selection determine the SVM's performance, which makes it a flexible and effective tool across a range of industries. For linear SVM, the decision function becomes
The Linear SVM objective function is:
The kernel approach allows SVM to be extended to accommodate non-linearly separable data. The higher-dimensional feature space where the data becomes linearly separable is transferred to the input features. Common kernel functions include the following.
•
Linear Kernel:
•
Polynomial Kernel:
•
Gaussian (RBF) Kernel:
8.1.5. Genetic algorithm
Genetic algorithms search using the principles of natural selection. Like genetics, they provide various solutions, are recombinant, and undergo mutation to produce new offspring. The reproduction likelihood is determined by the fitness of each solution depending on its objective function. Iteratively continuing until it ends, the process produces increasingly fitter people or better solutions [198].
The following steps usually comprise the Genetic algorithms workflow:
1) Initialization: Create a population of potential solutions, or chromosomes, within the search space using random generation or inflation. 2) Evaluation: The objective function value of each solution is determined to assess its fitness within the population. This function evaluates the ability of each solution to address the given problem. 3) Selection: Based on fitness, individuals from the population are chosen for reproduction. Similar to natural selection, solutions with higher fitness values have a larger chance of being chosen for reproduction. 4) Crossover: Crossover or recombination is used to pair specific individuals (parents) and produce offspring (children). Coming up with fresh ideas entails parents sharing genetic data. The one-point, two-point, and uniform crossover techniques are common crossover strategies. 5) Mutation: Arbitrary modifications or mutations are made to a portion of an offspring's genetic code. Mutation introduces new genetic material that may lead to better solutions and maintain population diversity. 6) Replacement: Newly developed children should be used to replace the least fit members of the current population. This guarantees that population size does not change over time. 7) Termination: The selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement processes are repeated for several generations or until a termination requirement is satisfied. Frequently used termination criteria include running out of computational resources, reaching the maximum number of generations, or arriving at a workable solution.
8.2. Deep learning algorithms
Deep learning methods for weed and plant disease detection use multi-layered neural networks to automatically identify patterns and features in aerial imagery taken by UAVs. These algorithms extract advanced representations directly from raw image data, which makes them excellent at identifying tiny differences in plant health states. To demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in advancing automated detection systems, this section examines some deep learning approaches that are frequently employed in UAV-based agricultural surveillance for disease and weed identification.
8.2.1. Artificial neural network
The computer model known as an Artificial neural network (ANN) is modeled after the biological neural networks observed in the human brain [199]. An input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer are among the layers comprising interconnected nodes. A neural network (ANN) uses incoming data and produces predictions or outputs using a procedure known as forward propagation. ANNs learn to minimize the discrepancy between the expected and actual outputs during training by using backpropagation to modify the weights of the connections between nodes. Artificial neural networks are extensively utilized in machine learning tasks, including pattern recognition, regression, and classification, owing to their ability to recognize intricate patterns and relationships in data. In neuron activation:
8.2.2. Capsule network (CapsNet)
In 2017, Geoffrey Hinton and colleagues presented capsule networks, or CapsNets, as a revolutionary solution to overcome constraints in conventional Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [200]. They aimed to solve problems such as managing spatial hierarchy and posing picture differences. CapsNets use “capsules,” which are collections of neurons that encode different attributes of particular traits. They then used dynamic routing algorithms to ascertain the connections between the capsules in various layers. This novel architecture represents a substantial breakthrough in the field of deep learning and shows promise for enhanced performance in tasks such as picture identification and understanding.
8.2.3. Convolutional neural networks
Convolutional neural networks are specialized deep-learning models that are frequently employed for image analysis and recognition. CNNs are used to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of information from input images. They draw inspiration from the human brain's visual cortex [201].
Convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers are used by CNNs to analyze and extract features from input data, typically images. Feature maps are produced by convolutional layers using filters to identify patterns such as edges and textures. Layers for pooling minimize the dimensionality of the feature maps without losing important information. The last stage, which is fully connected layers, combines features and performs regression or classification operations. CNNs benefit from this synergy by performing well in various applications, including natural language processing and image recognition. The convolution operation of the CNN is defined as:
where the output feature map is
Resnet: Presented at the IEEE Conference on Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision (CVPR) [202], ResNet, also known as Residual Network, is a revolutionary deep learning architecture. Adding skip connections allows information to flow directly from earlier to subsequent layers, mitigating the vanishing gradient issue in very deep neural networks. With these connections, it is possible to train very deep networks (hundreds or thousands of layers) without performance deterioration. ResNet has become a fundamental architecture in computer vision research and applications, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple picture classification benchmarks. Residual Block and Identity Mapping are some of the key components of Resnet. The basic form of the residual block is
Squeezenet: A compact CNN architecture called SqueezeNet was created for effective inference on devices with limited resources, such as embedded systems and mobile phones. It uses aggressive down-sampling and 1x1 convolutional filters to minimize the model size without compromising performance. SqueezeNet delivers good accuracy with substantially fewer computational and memory requirements by using fewer parameters than typical CNNs. Owing to its lightweight design, it can be used in real-world applications such as mobile object identification and image classification where computational resources are scarce. The Fire module is the basic building block of the SqueezeNet [203]. The mathematical Fire module can be represented as
VGG-19: The 19-layer VGG-19 convolutional neural network architecture comprises three fully connected layers after 16 convolutional layers. The University of Oxford's Visual Geometry Group (VGG) first presented this in 2014 [204]. VGG-19 is renowned for its uniform architecture and simplicity, with modest 3x3 filters and max-pooling layers for downsampling atop convolutional layers piled on top of each other. Deep learning architectures are effective, as demonstrated by VGG-19's excellent success in picture classification challenges, despite its simplicity and depth.
Mask R-CNN: A deep learning model called Mask R-CNN, or Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network, is intended for use in object detection and instance segmentation applications [205]. In addition to the current branch for classification and bounding box regression, it expands Faster R-CNN by including a branch for predicting segmentation masks in each Region of Interest (RoI). Since its introduction, Mask R-CNN has gained popularity as a model for applications including robotics, autonomous driving, and medical image analysis, which require accurate object localization and pixel-level segmentation.
Deep convolutional neural network: A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is an artificial neural network that uses numerous layers of convolutional processes for hierarchical learning and feature extraction to analyze structured grid data, particularly images [206].
DCNNs differ from CNNs because they have more layers and a deeper structure, allowing them to learn more intricate and abstract features from unprocessed input data.
R-CNN: Combining the strengths of region-based techniques and convolutional neural networks, RCNN was one of the first models to advance object detection [207].
YOLO: With excellent accuracy, You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a powerful object detection system that can quickly identify objects in images. In contrast to conventional techniques, YOLO performs an image processing task in a single pass, making predictions regarding bounding boxes and class probabilities [208]. For the loss function, the total loss function is
MobileNet: MobileNet is a condensed convolutional neural network architecture carefully designed to be used on embedded and mobile devices with limited processing resources. Its effectiveness stems from using depthwise separable convolutions, a method that drastically reduces model parameters and processing requirements without sacrificing accuracy [209].
8.2.4. Predictive coding/biassed competition-divisive input modulation (PC/BC-DIM) neural network
The PC/BC-DIM neural network is a hierarchical computational model that uses Divisive Input Modulation (DIM) with stable dynamic features. It combines ideas from predictive coding (PC) and biassed competition (BC) [210]. Drawing upon perceptual inference mechanisms found in the cortex, namely in the primary visual cortex (V1), this network functions based on the assumption that the responses of prediction neurons are dependent on projection errors. The PC/BC-DIM network efficiently performs visual perception tasks by modeling sensory-driven information interaction with top-down expectations in the cortex through the use of the PC model. Reconstruction neurons (R), error neurons (E), and prediction neurons (Y) are its three neuronal groups.
8.2.5. DepLabV3+
An enhanced deep neural network, DepLabV3+, is intended for semantic image segmentation applications. It correctly segments objects in images using cutting-edge deep-learning techniques. Enhancing DeepLabV3 and DepLabV3+ adds a decoder module to improve segmentation outcomes, particularly around object borders [211]. DepLabV3+ accomplishes a quicker and more reliable encoder-decoder network by combining atrous spatial pyramid pooling, decoder modules, Xception model, and depthwise separable convolution. The model successfully balances precision and runtime by enabling flexible control of the feature resolution through atrous convolution.

After careful analysis of the table, it can be concluded that Convolutional Neural Networks are the most used models in weed management. Other models, such as random forest, SVM, and k-means clustering, were also used. Like plant disease detection, most datasets are real-time in weed management. This means the images were captured using a drone at a specific location and time. Different drone categories were used for data collection. Some popular preprocessing methods used are feature extraction, data augmentation, image alignment, shadow removal, georeferencing, image segmentation, image resizing, etc. Most of the crops in focus were cereal, oilseed, and forage crops. Other types of crops, such as industrial fruits and vegetables, are also in focus. The CNN models have achieved the best result with over 99% accuracy. However, each model has a few limitations that can be addressed in future research.
10. Challanges and future research directions and discussion
Although UAV and AI technologies for weed control, plant disease identification and pest control have advanced significantly, there are still several barriers preventing these advancements from being fully used in real-world agricultural applications. Significant problems include a lack of practical feasibility data, an excessive dependence on vegetation indices, and limitations brought on by antiquated technology, which highlight the necessity of increasing the precision of data collection and analysis accuracy in order to satisfy the needs of various agricultural contexts. Inadequate hyperparameter tuning limits the model's adaptability and performance in practical applications, whereas labeling subjectivity in models affects the consistency and dependability of plant health assessments. Future studies are necessary to increase UAV technology's effectiveness, precision, and versatility in various agricultural settings, allowing these systems to accommodate different crop varieties and field circumstances. In-depth discussions of numerous other challenges and potential paths forward are provided in this part, shedding light on important avenues for developing AI-driven and UAV solutions and meeting the changing needs of precision agriculture.
10.1. Exploration of alternative vegetation indices
A prominent drawback in the field of plant disease detection is the limited investigation of substitute vegetation indices [212]. Researchers frequently focus on a predetermined set of indices that are thought to be important for identifying diseases, possibly ignoring other indices that could offer more or better information [213]. This constraint raises the possibility that the selected indices do not include all the spectral information necessary for accurate disease detection, which could lead to the exclusion of feature combinations that could be more useful for identifying and tracking plant diseases.
To address this constraint, scientists can expand the parameters of their research by including a more thorough investigation of substitute vegetation indexes [214]. Through the systematic evaluation of a more comprehensive array of indices, researchers can obtain a thorough understanding of the spectral signatures linked to ailing plants. This strategy improves the precision and dependability of detection techniques by making it easier to identify the best feature combinations for disease detection. Interdisciplinary teams of data scientists, remote sensing specialists, and agronomists can benefit from various backgrounds to guarantee comprehensive studies and optimize disease detection tactics.
10.2. Diversity in environmental conditions or regions
Research using UAVs to identify plant diseases is significantly impacted when environmental factors or geographic variety are not considered. Almost every study limits the applicability of its findings by conducting trials in a single region, as different ecological variables in different areas may produce different outcomes. Furthermore, the robustness and generalizability of the models are further restricted by their inability to consider variations in climatic and brightness conditions, with images consistently taken at the same time and day for training and testing the model.
Future UAV-based plant disease detection studies should cover various climatic variables and geographical areas. Researchers can better understand the effectiveness of disease detection models in various environmental contexts by conducting trials across several regions with variable climates, soil types, and vegetation densities. Furthermore, gathering images on multiple days and at different times of the day, taking seasonal variations into account, and combining data from other geographic regions helps improve the flexibility and dependability of the model in a range of environmental conditions. The accuracy and generalizability of UAV-based plant disease detection methodologies can be increased by working with agronomy, climatology, and remote sensing specialists to select representative regions and design experiments that effectively account for environmental variability.
10.3. Early stage detection and comprehensive disease stage verification
Plant diseases are difficult to recognize in the early stages because it can be challenging to identify their symptoms [215]. This challenge implies that the present methods may not be able to correctly diagnose diseases in the early stages of development, which could hinder the establishment of efficient disease management plans. Few studies have been conducted to confirm the various stages of damage caused by plant diseases [216], [217]. This research gap restricts the development of targeted therapies at each stage of infection and prevents thorough knowledge of disease evolution.
To solve these difficulties, future research should prioritize the development of detection methods that can accurately identify plant diseases in their early stages [218]. Technological advancements, such as integrating machine learning algorithms and remote sensing, can potentially increase the early detection capacity of disease detection technologies and expand their applicability to a broader range of plant species and environmental conditions. Moreover, conducting comprehensive studies to investigate all phases of plant disease damage would provide valuable insights into the dynamics of disease development and facilitate the development of tailored management strategies [109]. Researchers, agronomists, and stakeholders must collaborate to further these advancements and obtain effective disease management techniques for sustainable agriculture.
10.4. Background similarity
One major challenge in correctly identifying diseased trees is the presence of background similarity detection mistakes, especially when some soils have colors and textures similar to those of diseased vegetation. This background trait overlap presents a significant challenge because it may cause the soil to be mistaken for infected trees. These mistakes make detection techniques less reliable and increase the possibility of false positive outcomes. This problem emphasizes the necessity of additional research and improvements in disease identification procedures to lessen the influence of background similarity errors on overall accuracy.

Abstract
The dynamic change in global environment along with natural hindrances leads to several economic losses by causing several outbreaks and epidemics all over the world resulting in major threat to plants and human health quantitatively and qualitatively. To mitigate all these challenges, it is necessary to break the chain of these co-epidemic conditions which can be successfully accomplished by prior detection of the upcoming risk. Several advanced techniques have been emerged to face these extremities. Smart agriculture concept mainly deals with the modernisation of conventional detection and management tactics which would increase chances of early detection, precision monitoring, and occurrence of pest and diseases. Combination of two or more techniques such as remote sensing with artificial intelligence helps to diagnose characterises and monitors diseases and pest across different spatial scales. Besides remote sensing, there are other myriad techniques such as hyperspectral imaging, UAVs, information and communication, Internet of Things (IoTs), and imaging are available to cope with several disease and pests. Genetic engineering methodologies including CRISPR-Cas, RNAi, and nanotechnology-based proper application of fertilisers and agrochemicals control the plant disease and pest emergence before crossing their respective thresholds. This chapter provides a new perspective for sustainable agriculture from the current researches, new technology for observation of several crops, and their habitat since it not only helps to manage the pests and diseases but also aids in biophysical control on their emergence.

Intelligent pesticide prescription spraying (IPPS) technologies monitor, diagnose, and make scientific decisions about pests, diseases, and weeds; formulate personalized and precision control plans; and prevent and control pests through the use of intelligent equipment. This study discusses key IPSS technologies from four perspectives: target information acquisition, information processing, pesticide prescription spraying, and implementation and control. In the target information acquisition section, target identification technologies based on images, remote sensing, acoustic waves, and electronic nose are introduced. In the information processing section, information processing methods such as information pre-processing, feature extraction, pest and disease identification, bioinformatics analysis, and time series data are addressed. In the pesticide prescription spraying section, the impact of pesticide selection, dose calculation, spraying time, and method on the resulting effect and the formulation of prescription pesticide spraying in a certain area are explored. In the implement and control section, vehicle automatic control technology, precision spraying technology, and droplet characteristic control technology and their applications are studied. In addition, this study discusses the future development prospectives of IPPS technologies, including multifunctional target information acquisition systems, decision-support systems based on generative AI, and the development of precision intelligent sprayers. The advancement of these technologies will enhance agricultural productivity in a more efficient, environmentally sustainable manner.
Keywords: control of pests, diseases, and weeds; intelligent pesticides prescription spraying; key technologies; development outlooks
1. Introduction
Controlling pests, diseases, and weeds in modern agricultural production is key to ensuring healthy crop growth and improving product yield and quality. With changes in the ecological environment and continuous progress in agricultural production, the types of pests, diseases, and weeds and their occurrence patterns are also changing, bringing new challenges. While pesticide spraying is still the most effective and important measure of controlling pests, diseases, and weeds, spraying chemical pesticides can cause environmental pollution and result in pesticide residues in agricultural products.
The research and application of the key technologies for intelligent pesticide prescription spraying (IPPS) are significant for improving efficiency and precision in controlling pests, diseases, and weeds. These technologies involve the cross-disciplinary integration of fields such as modern information technology, biotechnology, mechanical and electronic engineering, botany, and pesticide science. The rapid development of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and AIhas also facilitated significant advances in the research and application of IPPS technologies. The timeline of IPPS development is shown in Figure 1. This technological evolution has transformed IPPS technologies from simple mechanical applications to modern, sophisticated, integrated systems that combine multiple technologies for precise, efficient, and environmentally friendly pest management.
Intelligent monitoring refers to the automated and continuous surveillance of agricultural conditions using advanced technologies with sensors and data analysis systems. Through remote sensing technology and drones, the intelligent monitoring of farmland can provide real-time information on the occurrence and development of pests, diseases, and weeds. Big data and artificial intelligence technologies are employed to analyze patterns and trends in the occurrence of pests, diseases, and weeds, thereby providing a scientific basis for control decisions. IPPS must be precisely aligned with the objective and minimize side effects on human health, non-target organisms, and the environment by avoiding excessive doses, reducing application frequency, or employing fractional applications. It is essential that the associated risk to vegetation remains acceptable and does not increase the risk of resistance development in harmful organism populations [1].
While previous studies have significantly contributed to individual aspects of IPPS technologies, several important gaps remain in the existing literature. First, most studies focus on single technological components (such as image recognition and spraying systems) rather than comprehensively analyzing the entire IPPS system integration. Second, there is a limited systematic analysis of how different technologies interact and complement each other within the IPPS framework. Third, existing reviews often lack a detailed discussion of the practical challenges in implementing IPPS technologies across different agricultural contexts. Fourth, insufficient attention has been paid to integrating emerging technologies, such as generative AI and edge computing, into IPPS systems. Finally, previous studies have not adequately addressed how IPPS technologies can be optimized for different scales of agricultural operations, from small farms to large commercial operations. This study addresses these gaps by comprehensively analyzing IPPS technologies from a system-level perspective, examining technological integration and practical implementation challenges.
This study focuses on the key technologies of IPPS for pest, disease, and weed control, including intelligent monitoring technology; accurate diagnostic technology for pests, diseases, and weeds; intelligent decision-making technology; and advanced pesticide application technology. The objective is to develop personalized and precise control programs that provide scientific, efficient, and environmentally sustainable solutions for managing pests, diseases, and weeds in agricultural production. By analyzing and summarizing these key technologies, we hope to provide more accurate and intelligent pest and weed control strategies for agricultural production so that agriculture can be greener, smarter, and more efficient. By utilizing advanced application equipment to implement a comprehensive suite of technical systems, IPPS technologies markedly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of pest, disease, and weed control, reduce pesticide residues, protect the ecological environment, reduce agricultural production costs, and increase farmers’ income.
The implementation of IPPS technologies still faces several significant challenges. These include scalability issues when deploying across large agricultural areas, substantial initial investment costs for equipment and infrastructure, and potential environmental concerns, such as electromagnetic interference from sensors and electronic devices. Additionally, the complexity of integrating multiple technologies and the need for specialized training for farmers pose practical challenges to widespread adoption. Understanding and addressing these challenges are crucial for implementing IPPS technologies in modern agriculture. Therefore, this study proposes future research directions for IPPS technology.
2. Analysis of IPPS Process and Key Technologies
Figure 2 illustrates the logical sequence of pesticide prescription spraying. First, the relevant information regarding the target plant (images, spectral information, acoustic signals, etc.) must be obtained. Second, the relevant data must be preprocessed to improve quality and quantity. Third, information parsing techniques should be employed to analyze the preprocessed data and determine the classification and severity of pests and diseases affecting the target plant. Fourth, pesticide spraying prescriptions (usage, dosage, and precautions) should be designed based on the plant’s defense mechanisms and past disease data. Fifth, to ensure that sprayers can accurately reach the designated location and independently complete the spraying task, they must integrate navigation positioning with autonomous driving technology. Finally, various precise pesticide spraying techniques must be adopted to increase efficiency and reduce pesticide usage.
By analyzing the logical sequence diagram and the key IPPS technologies for pest, disease, and weed control, we conclude that IPPS technologies should include four layers, as shown in Figure 3. The first layer is the target information acquisition layer. This layer employs images, spectra, and other information acquisition tools to obtain information regarding the canopy and health state of target plants. The second layer is the information processing layer. This layer improves the quality and quantity of data and derives the corresponding characteristic parameters through various preprocessing and information analysis techniques. It also combines bioinformatics, molecular biology, and other technologies to comprehensively analyze pest, disease, and weed categories, distribution, and severity. The third layer is the pesticide prescription spraying layer. This layer is based on the type, distribution, and severity of pests, diseases, and weeds used to formulate the prescription. It aims to achieve specialized treatment of specific pests and precise pesticide spraying. At the same time, this layer also builds databases, including those for pest and weed information and pesticide classification data. These databases provide data support for the pesticide spraying model and ensure that the generated prescriptions are scientific. The fourth layer is the implement and control layer, which can implement precise on-target variable flow rate pesticide spraying techniques based on the prescription map generated by the target information, such as the plants’ canopy volume size and density.
3. Target Information Acquisition Layer
The target information acquisition layer includes common target information acquisition systems, such as machine vision, remote sensing, acoustic wave, and electronic nose, and carrying platforms for different target information acquisition devices. Vehicles are the most traditional image and spectral information acquisition device carriers due to their relatively low cost, versatility across various settings, and substantial expansion capabilities [2], enabling the integration of speed, flow, and pressure sensors [3] as well as laser sensors [4]. Remote sensing systems comprise remote sensing platforms, sensors, information transmission devices, digital or image processing equipment, and other related technologies [5]. Compared with traditional satellite remote sensing monitoring platforms, UAVs can operate at lower altitudes (80–400 m), offset the effects of extreme weather and cloud cover [6], achieve fast and accurate acquisition of high-precision images [7,8,9], and advance agricultural production toward superior quality, efficiency, safety, informatization, and intelligence [10]. This positions UAVs as a crucial tool for large-scale monitoring of pests, diseases, and weeds in the future [11].
3.1. Image-Based Target Information Acquisition Technology
To achieve the accuracy and reliability of precision pesticide spraying, it is necessary to obtain relevant plant damage information in a targeted manner to identify and locate pests, diseases, and weeds. Plants are infested by different pests, diseases, and weeds in different growth periods. Therefore, it is necessary to collect image sets of target plants susceptible to pests, diseases, and weeds in different periods and adequately train the model to improve the generalization ability and build a model that can accurately identify different pests, diseases, and weeds. Mimic weeds and several plants exhibit similarities in color and appearance, rendering standard methods inadequate for achieving high recognition accuracy. Therefore, image-based target information acquisition technology needs to improve the accuracy of crop and weed discrimination through various algorithms, even after collecting images of an area.
Image acquisition technology acquires high-quality images through various equipment and methods, which are simple and easy to operate and can provide strong technical support for the early identification and precise control of pests, diseases, and weeds. Commonly used devices include digital cameras, high-definition cameras carried by UAVs [12], automatic camera equipment fixed in the field, and high-precision scanning equipment. Digital cameras and fixed camera equipment usually have high resolution and good sensitivity and are suitable for working under various weather and light conditions. By shooting under sufficient light and acquiring images from different angles and distances, clear and comprehensive information can be obtained to support subsequent image analysis and identification of pests, diseases, and weeds. UAVs equipped with high-definition cameras are flexible and able to move quickly, making them suitable for large-scale image acquisition. UAVs can take pictures at different heights and angles, providing image data from multiple viewpoints and boosting precision agriculture. High-precision scanning equipment is mainly used to scan targets such as victim plant leaves to obtain high-resolution images. The scanning process must ensure uniform lighting to avoid reflections or shadows that affect image quality [13,14,15,16,17]. The types of equipment include stationary scanners, portable scanning equipment, and UAV scanning equipment.
3.1.1. Color
After some plants become diseased, they will produce disease spots that are different in color from the plants themselves [18], and the color of weeds often differs from the color of crops. Therefore, after collecting images of diseased plants and healthy plants (or weeds and crops), it is possible to judge whether the crop is diseased or identify weeds by comparing the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) components of different images.
For example, when cucumber grows normally, there is a white horizontal line on the leading edge of the stem and leaves, and the surface of the leaves is in the form of a serrated triangle. When cucumber suffers from powdery mildew, the initial leaf color ranges from white to grayish-white, and in severe cases, the whole leaf wilts. When it suffers from spot blotch, yellowish or grayish-white spots can be observed on the leaf’s surface [19]. While UAVs are not typically used in greenhouse environments where cucumbers are often grown due to climate change, stationary or portable imaging systems can effectively monitor plant health.
3.1.2. Morphology
When plants are attacked by different pests, diseases, and weeds at different growth periods, the leaves will show different shapes and sizes of spots, which can be analyzed by comparing them with the normal leaves to find out which diseases plants suffer from or which pests are affecting them.
3.1.3. Texture
Texture-based identification of pests and diseases combines image processing, texture analysis, and machine learning techniques to identify and classify pests and diseases by analyzing texture features on the surface of plants or pests.
For example, the pectinate setae on the dorsal plate of the abdomen of Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett) are key textural features that can be recognized by machine vision and image processing techniques to provide a basis for pest control [20]. The textural characteristics of target plants can be extracted by preprocessing and segmenting images and then detected using the random forest model, which can solve low accuracy, overfitting, and high error rates [21].
3.1.4. Multiple Features
Multi-feature-based identification of pests, diseases, and weeds is a comprehensive approach that utilizes multiple data features and advanced machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of identification. This process combines image processing, sensor data analysis, and deep learning models using multiple sensors (e.g., RGB cameras, thermal imagers, and spectral cameras) to capture different data types from which multiple features, such as color, shape, texture, and spectrum, are extracted. These data are fused into a comprehensive feature set and subsequently fed into deep learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs)) or other algorithms (e.g., random forest and support vector machines) for training. By learning from large amounts of labeled data, these models can identify and classify various pests, diseases, and weeds more comprehensively and accurately, thus providing more effective decision support for integrated pest management (IPM).
For example, the color and shape of wormholes can be simultaneously analyzed as feature parameters, and the ratio of insect pest occurrence area to leaf area can be defined as an index for determining the severity of insect pests to achieve accurate determination of insect pests and provide a reference for precise pesticide spraying [22]. The color difference algorithm can also be used to isolate the diseased area of the target plant, and the diseases can be classified by combining the color histogram and texture features [23].
3.2. Target Information Acquisition Technology Based on Remote Sensing
As shown in Figure 4 [24,25,26], as a non-contact, long-range detection technology, the sensors loaded on the remote sensing platform can detect and receive electromagnetic waves emitted and reflected by different objects on the ground surface, which are converted into raw images according to a certain law and then transmitted to the ground-based computing processing center to derive the characteristic information of the target plants, including the canopy and diseases [26], to efficiently obtain agricultural information on pests, diseases, and weeds. In controlling possible pests, diseases, and weeds, satellite remote sensing has many advantages, such as a large monitoring area [26] and sufficient spectral information [27], which can realize the dynamic monitoring of pests, diseases, and weeds on a large scale. It can also analyze the relationship between the development pattern of pests, diseases, and weeds and the environment, providing a scientific basis for prevention and control initiatives in advance [28,29,30].
3.2.1. Multispectral
Multispectral remote sensing techniques analyze surface features by capturing spectral information at different wavelengths. Different plant statuses, such as healthy, infested by pests and weeds, water shortage, etc., reflect and absorb different wavelengths of light, resulting in changes in the spectral features that reflect the health of the vegetation [1]. By analyzing these spectral characteristics indicators, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [31], Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI) [32], and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) [33], we were able to determine the health status of the vegetation and identify and classify pests, diseases, and weeds. Multispectral remote sensing is commonly used to monitor and assess pests, diseases, and weeds and identify potential problems before they cause significant losses. Figure 5 shows a schematic diagram of multispectral remote sensing used to identify trees and weeds. Note that t01 to t06 denote the identified tree 1 through tree 6, respectively.
3.2.2. Hyperspectral
Hyperspectral remote sensing technology can capture more detailed and broader spectral information than multispectral remote sensing, providing more spectral details and features. Hyperspectral remote sensing technology enhances the accuracy and reliability of target identification by capturing the reflectance or emission spectra of surface materials in a large number of consecutive narrow bands, resulting in a spectral profile of tens to hundreds of bands for each pixel point [34]. When pests infest plant leaves, their biochemical and structural properties change, which affects their spectral reflectance. These changes can be analyzed to identify and monitor pests, diseases, and weeds [35]. Hyperspectral remote sensing is suitable for accurately identifying and monitoring specific pests, weeds, and diseases. However, hyperspectral remote sensing involves a large amount of data, making processing costs high.
3.2.3. Near-Infrared
Near-infrared (NIR) remote sensing technology mainly uses the reflective properties of plant leaves to infrared light to monitor plant health [14]. Healthy plant leaves absorb a large amount of visible light and reflect a large amount of near-infrared light due to their rich chlorophyll content [15]. When pests, diseases, and weeds attack plants, the chlorophyll content decreases, decreasing the reflectance of near-infrared light, and the infested plants can be identified by monitoring this change [16,34]. Near-infrared remote sensing technology can cover a wide area and quickly obtain information on the health status of crops over large areas. However, when the pests are unevenly distributed or in the early stages of infestation, infrared remote sensing technology is insufficient to identify small-scale or early pest and weed infestations due to spatial resolution limitations.
3.2.4. Thermal Infrared
Thermal infrared remote sensing technology is based on the changes in surface temperature of plant leaves [36,37] and can be used to monitor plants’ transpiration and health status by capturing changes in surface temperature [38]. Plants release water through transpiration to regulate body temperature. When plants are infested, and transpiration is affected, the changes in leaf surface temperature can be sensed to monitor pests, diseases, and weeds.
3.2.5. Synthetic Aperture Radar
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology utilizes the ability of radar waves to penetrate clouds and parts of vegetation by transmitting electromagnetic waves to the ground and then receiving the signals reflected. Analyzing these reflected signals can obtain information about ground targets [39]. Different ground substances and conditions (e.g., humidity, structure, material, etc.) affect the reflective properties of radar waves. By analyzing SAR image data, the type of pest and weed infestations can be identified [40]. Because microwaves can penetrate clouds and a certain degree of vegetation cover, SAR is suitable for all-weather, all-day monitoring. However, SAR has problems such as difficulty in interpretation.
3.2.6. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
Remote sensing equipment carried by UAVs is increasingly used in precision agriculture and pest and weed management due to its low cost, high flexibility, and high resolution. UAVs can carry cameras [41,42] and sensors such as multispectral, hyperspectral [43], and thermal infrared sensors for pest, disease, and weed detection, monitoring, and assessment in localized areas. UAV remote sensing is particularly suitable for fine management and small-scale, high-precision monitoring of pests, diseases, and weeds [44].
3.2.7. Light Detection and Ranging
As a 3D remote sensing technology, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is used to obtain precise 3D positional information of targets, including tree height, canopy density, and canopy cover, by emitting laser pulses and measuring the time when these pulses are reflected from the target [45,46]. LiDAR has the advantage of acquiring high-precision data elevation models, digital surface models, orthophotos, digital line drawings, 3D scenes, and 3D model construction. It has the advantages of small environmental constraints, low operating costs, fast acquisition speed, and high data accuracy [47]. The information obtained through fluorescence LiDAR helps users to understand vegetation’s health and growth environment, thus identifying unfavorable conditions that may lead to pests, diseases, and weeds [17]. However, detecting fluorescence through dye powder-dusted insects would be technologically complex and costly under field conditions. Modern LiDAR technology that can incorporate spectrum distribution and the use of multiple wavelengths has the characteristics of being unrestricted by light conditions and having a strong penetration ability. However, this technology still has shortcomings, such as difficult data processing, high equipment costs, and difficulty interpreting.
LiDAR can be classified according to the type of signal form, detection mode, number of lines, functional use, scanning mode, laser light source, delivery platform, etc. The classification of LiDAR is shown in Figure 6.
The vehicle-mounted 2D laser scanner is used to acquire unilateral point cloud data of trees, and after coordinate transformation and discretization, the scale information related to the target plant is calculated to achieve online measurement of canopy volume in continuous/discontinuous scenarios of tree crowns and provide technical support for precision pesticide application [48]. Combining airborne laser and aerial multispectral data can automatically identify pest and weed outbreak areas and predict infestation probability.
3.3. Target Information Acquisition Technology Based on Acoustic Waves
Acoustic waves are mechanical waves that can propagate through air, liquids, and solids. Different substances and structures have different acoustic wave reflection, absorption, and transmission properties, which provide the basis for identification and detection. Acoustic wave-based target information collection technology detects and identifies crop pests, diseases, and weeds using acoustic wave properties.
Common acoustic detection methods include the following:
Accelerometers detect vibrations by measuring surface acceleration. Vibrations or impacts can be sensed in one or more axes. They are usually fixed on the plant surface and detect small vibrations generated by internal insect activity [49]. However, the application to mass cultivation is limited due to the impracticality of deploying sensors on millions of individual plants in large-scale agricultural settings;
Piezoelectric crystals are used to convert mechanical stress directly into an electrical signal. When stressed, the crystal generates a measurable electrical charge capable of capturing and converting acoustic waves or vibrations into electrical signals for detecting insect activity [50,51];
Acoustic probes with integrated piezoelectric sensors or accelerometers can be inserted into soil, crops, or trees to record and analyze acoustic signals generated by insect activity. Different insect pests are automatically identified by signal processing algorithms [52];
The principle of microphone pest identification is mainly based on impact acoustic (IA) measurements. It collects and analyzes the acoustic signals generated when crop samples are impacted with specific materials (e.g., steel plates) and captures them using a high-sensitivity microphone. Subsequently, the frequency and amplitude characteristics of the signals are input into the neural network for analysis to determine whether the crop is infested and its severity [53];
Ultrasonic waves generated by an ultrasonic transducer can detect insect pests in trees. Time of flight (TOF) is a parameter that measures the time it takes for an acoustic wave to propagate a certain distance in a medium. TOF is overly sensitive to defects in trees. By measuring the TOF of acoustic waves, ultrasonic transducers can effectively detect insect pests in a tree and assess the overall health of trees [54].
These acoustic detection methods perform well in laboratory environments but face challenges in practical applications such as background noise and wind interference. In addition, the installation of sensors may damage samples, and signal interpretation may be complicated.
3.4. Target Information Acquisition Technology Based on Electronic Nose
Target information collection technology based on an electronic nose (e-nose) is a diagnostic method of detecting and identifying various plant pests, diseases, and weeds using e-nose devices. The e-nose simulates a biological olfactory system and consists of a sensor array, a signal conditioning circuit, and a pattern recognition algorithm. Plants release specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when infested with pests and diseases or confronted with weeds [55,56]. When VOCs pass through the sensor array, they cause reversible physicochemical changes in the sensing materials, which alter electrical properties such as resistance and potential.
In diagnosing early aphid infestation in greenhouse tomato plants, VOCs released from healthy and aphid-infested tomato plants can be infested and analyzed using e-noses equipped with multiple gas sensors and data acquisition systems to identify aphid infestation before the plants show visible symptoms [57]. However, the diagnostic method in controlled greenhouse environments might not apply and needs modification for open spaces.
A portable e-nose was developed to assess the damage caused by cotton pests, including stink bugs, by extracting VOCs from the headspace of a cotton boll using carbon black-polymer composite sensors. The device can classify the cotton as damaged or undamaged by differentiating VOCs released from undamaged or damaged bolls. However, environmental factors may affect sensor response, so it would be beneficial to train the device in the same environmental conditions to minimize the effects of these factors [58].
Systemic resistance-induced defense-associated VOCs significantly affect the VOC signature of diseased plants. Volatile plant defense and protective compounds include terpenoids, essential oils, plant hormones, secondary metabolites, other metabolic byproducts, and compounds associated with cell damage. The changes in plant VOC emissions associated with plant diseases eventually led to collective VOC analysis using sensor arrays in e-noses [59]. The e-nose has a low threshold for detecting VOCs and does not require physical contact or damage to the plant. In addition, e-nose systems have the advantages of being low in cost and simple to use, with no extensive training required, fast results, convenient portability, and high accuracy [60]. However, other environmental odors may interfere with the detection results and require complex algorithms for data analysis.
3.5. Target Information Acquisition Technology Based on IoT
IoT technology in agriculture refers to the application of IoT sensors [61,62] and systems originally developed for various sensors, wireless communication technologies (e.g., LoRa, NB-IoT, 4G/5G, etc.), and data processing platforms. These technologies are applied to achieve real-time monitoring, intelligent analysis, and precise management of the agricultural production environment and crop growth conditions [63,64]. This enables precise management and intelligent control of agricultural production [65], improving efficiency and product quality, reducing environmental pollution, saving resources, and lowering costs [66]. Agricultural IoT technology involves collecting, storing, processing, and analyzing agricultural information data, relying on cloud computing technology, big data technology, edge computing technology [67,68], etc. With the continuous development of technology and reduction in costs, agricultural IoT technology will be more widely used in IPPS technologies in the future.
IPPS would not be possible without IoT sensors. Sensors are used to gather and measure different factors and variables of environments that could affect crop yield [69] and monitor anomalies, weeds, diseases, pests, and crop mapping with the help of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution [70,71,72].
The agricultural IoT technology is deeply integrated with the above-mentioned technologies. The strengths and weaknesses of different target collection technologies were analyzed, as shown in Table 1.
4. Information Processing Layer
The information processing layer includes preprocessing techniques to improve the quality of the dataset and increase the number of samples in the dataset; information analysis techniques to analyze the relationship between various indicators and features and pests, diseases, and weeds; and model improvement techniques to improve the generalization ability and accuracy of the model. In addition, a variety of methods, such as deep learning, image recognition, geographic information system (GIS), time series analysis, data mining, and molecular biology and chemical inducer detection, have been widely used, which not only improve the accuracy and real-time performance of the identification of pests, diseases, and weeds but also provide a scientific basis in the development of control strategies, making an important contribution to the sustainable development of modern agriculture.
4.1. Information Preprocessing Techniques
Information preprocessing techniques in pest, disease, and weed identification processes acquire target images or data to improve identification accuracy and efficiency. These techniques include but are not limited to image preprocessing, data cleaning, data enhancement, and data conversion.
Image preprocessing is a critical step in identifying pests, diseases, and weeds, and its main purpose is to improve the image quality and make it more suitable for subsequent processing steps [73,74] to increase the correctness of identification. Common image preprocessing techniques include image enhancement [75], image denoising [76,77], and image segmentation [78,79];
Data cleaning is a key step in data preprocessing, and the cleaned data are more suitable for analysis and modeling, improving the accuracy and reliability of pest, disease, and weed identification and classification. It includes using statistical methods to identify outliers, remove duplicate data, and remove or fill in missing values;
Data enhancement is a common technique used in the training process of deep learning models to generate new training samples by rotating [80], flipping, cropping, etc., plant images containing pests or disease spots, thus increasing the diversity of the data and improving the generalization ability of the model [81,82];
Data conversion is an important step in data preprocessing, which converts data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling. For example, data normalization is important when dealing with non-image data (e.g., temperature, humidity, soil pH, etc.) related to pests, diseases, and weeds. It aims to transform data from different sources to the same scale to eliminate the effect of data magnitude [83,84], and commonly used methods include maximum–minimum normalization and z-score normalization. When dealing with data with exponential growth, logarithmic transformation is often used to reduce the skewness of the data. When performing classification tasks, one-host encoding and label encoding are often used for processing, and they can convert categorical variables into binary vectors or integers.
In summary, information preprocessing techniques for pest, disease, and weed identification are complex processes that include multiple steps, such as image preprocessing, data normalization, feature extraction and selection, and data enhancement. These techniques can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of pest recognition.
4.2. Target Feature Extraction and Identification of Pests, Diseases, and Weeds
Target feature extraction involves identifying and utilizing key features to classify and identify pesticide spraying target information. Feature extraction is the process of converting raw data into a form that is more suitable for model processing. It uses data mining, deep learning, and image recognition. Additionally, feature selection selects the most useful parts from these features to reduce the model’s complexity and improve recognition efficiency [85]. Common features include color features [86], shape features [87,88], and texture features [89].
4.2.1. Data Mining
Data mining techniques play a vital role in target identification and prediction. Data mining is the process of extracting useful information and knowledge from a large amount of data, including various techniques such as statistics, machine learning, and pattern recognition. Using data mining techniques can help better elucidate and predict the occurrence of pests, diseases, and weeds so that more effective preventive and control measures can be taken [90,91].
Data mining technology application scenarios include automatically identifying pests, diseases, and weeds by analyzing plants’ images or other sensory data using image processing and pattern recognition techniques [92]. By analyzing historical pests, diseases, weeds, and related environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.), machine learning models are used to predict the probability and severity of future infestation [93,94]. Combined with GIS and remote sensing techniques, the risk of pests, diseases, and weeds in a specific area can be analyzed to provide a reference for agricultural production [95,96].
Key data mining techniques include classification, regression, cluster analysis, and association rule mining.
Classification algorithms such as decision trees [97], random forest (RF) [98], and support vector machine (SVM) [99] are used to identify types of pests, diseases, and weeds. Regression algorithms such as linear regression [100] and ridge regression [101] are used to predict pest, disease, and weed severity.
The distribution pattern of pests, weeds, and diseases is analyzed through clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering, etc.) to help decision makers formulate regional prevention and control strategies [102,103,104].
Association rule mining is important to ascertain the correlation between the occurrence of pests, diseases, and weeds and the underlying environmental factors. This knowledge is fundamental for developing and implementing effective pest, disease, and weed control strategies [105].
4.2.2. Deep Learning and Image Recognition
By using deep learning (DL) models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), features can be automatically extracted from plant images to achieve fast and accurate identification of various pests, diseases, and weeds [106,107]. This technology improves the efficiency and accuracy of recognition and enables real-time monitoring of large farmland areas, helping farmers identify and deal with problems promptly, thereby improving crop yield and quality.
In pest, disease, and weed identification and early warning systems, image recognition technology can automatically identify and classify target features using computer vision technology to interpret and understand the content of images [87,108]. Dynamic acquisition of crop morphology is more beneficial to real-time variable decisions of precise spraying operations in fields [109].
As a deep learning-based target detection algorithm, You Only Look Once (YOLO) uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for target detection. The network architecture of YOLO usually includes multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers for feature extraction and target detection. YOLO is trained through an end-to-end approach that can simplify the design and implementation of the model, enabling it to efficiently perform target pest detection [110]. YOLO treats target detection as a regression problem rather than a classification problem. It predicts bounding box and category probabilities directly from the image. Unlike two-stage detection (e.g., R-CNN family), YOLO requires only one forward propagation to complete the agricultural disease detection [111].
The real-time detection capability of YOLO makes it well suited for enabling rapid identification and localization of pests, diseases, and weeds on crops [112,113] and early prediction of pests, diseases, and weeds [114]. Due to its single-stage detection nature, YOLO can operate efficiently in environments with limited computational resources, which is important for agricultural field detection [115]. YOLO can detect multiple pests, diseases, and weeds at the same time [116,117], which is useful for complex agricultural environments.
Compared to CNNs, some novel improved neural networks, such as the cascaded attention transformer network (CATNet) [118,119], generate adversarial-driven cross-aware network (GACNet) [120], and spatial, spectral, and texture-aware attention network (SSTNet) using hyperspectral images [121], have introduced attention mechanisms, improved the efficiency of target feature extraction, and achieved higher recognition accuracy.
After data preprocessing and feature extraction, a suitable model is selected for training so that the model can accurately identify the types of pests, diseases, and weeds. However, limited by the amount of training samples and time cost, the training efficiency can be improved by utilizing transfer and incremental learning. Transfer learning utilizes models pre-trained on other large datasets as a starting point, and they are fine-tuned for specific pest identification tasks [111,122]. Over time, incremental learning continuously incorporates newly collected data into the training set and continues to train the model to improve its accuracy and adaptability [123,124].
4.3. Analysis of Target Biological Characteristics
In addition to traditional target identification methods, molecular biology and chemical inducer detection technologies can increasingly provide new, in-depth ways to understand pests, diseases, and weeds at the microscopic genetic and metabolic levels with the rapid development of biotechnology. These methods enable earlier and more precise identification of targets and provide insights into the physiological mechanisms of pests, diseases, and weeds as well as the plant defense responses, thus providing new perspectives and bases for precision pesticide spraying.
4.3.1. Target Identification Technology Based on Molecular Biology
Target identification techniques based on molecular biology methods mainly aim to identify and study the key biological characteristics of pathogens, pests, and weeds that cause crop damage to develop more effective control strategies. The common molecular biology target identification methods include genomics and transcriptomics analysis, proteomics and metabolomics, molecular marker technology, and gene editing techniques.
Detecting the genome [125] and transcriptome [126] of pathogens, pests, or weeds can identify key genes or gene expression patterns associated with developing diseases, pests, or weeds. This information is essential for understanding the pests’ biology, the infestation process, and the interaction mechanism with the host plant;
The proteomics and metabolomics techniques involve studying proteins [125] and metabolites [126,127,128] of pathogens, pests or weeds. New intervention points can be discovered by identifying key proteins and metabolic pathways;
Specific genes or genomic regions associated with diseases, pests, or weeds can be traced and identified using molecular marker technology. This helps to understand the genetic diversity of pests and pathogens and their resistance mechanisms to pesticides [129,130];
Gene editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, can be used to knock out or modify specific genes of pathogens, pests, or weeds to study the function of these genes and their role in the physiological activities of the organism. This helps to validate potential control targets [131,132,133].
4.3.2. Chemical Inducer Detection
The discovery and identification of specific molecules or biological processes that can be used to control pathogens, pests, or weeds is also a key strategy in target identification technology. Chemical inducer detection technology involves identifying and analyzing specific chemicals produced by plants when infested by pathogens or pests or subjected to other stressful conditions. These chemicals, often called phytohormones or signaling molecules, such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene, play a key role in the plant’s defense response. The main methods of chemical inducer detection techniques include high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)–ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
HPLC [134]-UPLC [135] is the most commonly used chemical analysis technique. It can accurately separate, identify, and quantitatively analyze plant chemical inducers. Through HPLC-UPLC, it is possible to identify specific compounds released by plants when they are infested and thus understand the role of these compounds in plant defense;
GC-MS is another powerful analytical technique that is particularly suitable for the analysis of VOCs released by plants under attack by pests, diseases, and weeds that may serve to attract natural enemies or suppress pests [136,137];
LC-MS combines liquid chromatography’s separation capability with mass spectrometry’s identification capability and is suitable for analyzing non-volatile and polar compounds. LC-MS can detect and identify secondary metabolites and signaling molecules in the plant body, which play a key role in plant defense responses [138];
ELISA is an antibody-based biochemical technique that can be used for the specific detection and quantitative analysis of plant hormones and other protein markers. The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA make it ideal for detecting plant signaling molecules at low concentrations [139].
These chemical inducer detection techniques allow for a deeper understanding of plant defense mechanisms, which can lead to the discovery and development of new and more effective pest, disease, and weed control strategies. These strategies may include the development of a chemical inducer that stimulates or enhances the plant’s defense response or the design of synthetic compounds that target specific chemical inducers to interfere with the physiological processes of the pests or pathogens.
The strengths and weaknesses of target biological characteristics analysis compared to traditional and DL methods are shown in Table 2.
4.4. Time Series Analysis for Pest and Disease Prediction
GIS can collect, manage, and analyze geospatial data [140]. GIS uses satellites, UAVs, and ground carriers to collect information on agricultural conditions and analyze and process them using image processing, data fusion, time series analysis, and spatial analysis. Then, combining past data and current information, GIS is used to build a prediction model for pests, diseases, and weeds and assess future risks. By analyzing the potential impacts of pests, diseases, and weeds on crop yield and quality [141], targeted pest, disease, and weed control measures are developed based on the results of GIS analysis [142].
Time series analysis is a statistical method for analyzing chronological data points to understand past behavior, predict future trends, or identify meaningful patterns from data.
The application of time series analysis techniques in target identification involves using time series data to monitor and identify pests, diseases, and weeds. Time series data can be temperature, humidity, light, plant growth indicators, etc., usually collected through sensors over time. Time series analysis can help predict the probability and severity of pests, diseases, and weeds over time by analyzing target data. This is extremely helpful in developing preventive and control measures in advance. In addition, environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall directly impact the occurrence of pests, diseases, and weeds. Time series analysis can be used to analyze the relationship between these environmental factors and the occurrence of pests, weeds, and diseases, thus predicting the risk of infestation under specific environmental conditions.
Common technical approaches to time series analysis include autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models [143]. Some models are extensions of these two models, including the following:
The autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model combines the features of AR and MA models, which is used as a statistical model for analyzing and forecasting time series data and is suitable for analyzing smooth time series data. The ARMA model allows for modeling quantitative changes in insect populations and analyzing population growth, decline, and cyclical fluctuations. While traditional population dynamics models are usually deterministic, ARMA models can introduce random factors to better simulate the effects of unpredictable factors in the real environment on the population. ARMA models can help quantify the strength and stability of population regulation, particularly density-dependence and feedback mechanisms. ARMA models can identify and integrate time-lagged and seasonal patterns, which are essential for accurately predicting the occurrence and development of pests, diseases, and weeds. Through these features, ARMA models play an important role in identifying pests, diseases, and weeds, helping researchers and farmers better understand and manage the dynamics of insect populations [144];
The autoregressive integrated sliding average (ARIMA) model is an extension of the ARMA model that handles non-stationary time series data. For example, Trialeurodes vaporariorum is a major pest of greenhouse crops and can transmit various plant viruses, and traditional pesticide spraying methods are costly and may negatively impact the environment and farmers’ health. Models based on time series analysis (ARIMA and ARIMAX; X is the external variable) were developed to predict Trialeurodes vaporariorum population growth in greenhouses. Predicting changes in Trialeurodes vaporariorum populations helps farmers schedule pesticide spraying more efficiently. In contrast to the ARIMA model, which uses only Trialeurodes vaporariorum population data, the ARIMAX model combines Trialeurodes vaporariorum population and environmental data (e.g., temperature and humidity), which can predict population growth of Trialeurodes vaporariorum more effectively. Automating data collection and analysis enables farmers to manage pests in more timely and accurate ways, reduce pesticide usage, and improve the sustainability of agricultural production [145];
The seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model is an extension of the ARIMA model and is specifically designed to deal with data with distinct seasonal patterns. For example, the mango flea beetle is a major pest of mango in tropical and subtropical regions of India and can cause up to 100% yield loss. Using SARIMA to predict mango flea beetle populations can provide a timely and accurate advance prediction of mango flea beetle occurrence and provide a scientific basis for developing regional integrated pest management strategies. Applying the SARIMA model to pest, disease, and weed identification not only improves the accuracy of prediction but also provides farmers with a scientific decision-support tool that can help better cope with the challenges posed by climate change [146].
Effective timing prediction and possible epidemiological trends in pests, diseases, and weeds are the keys to control and management. Research on the growth and reproduction habits of pests, diseases, and weeds provides a basis for developing appropriate timing of control and prevention and analyzing the impact of different environmental conditions on pests, diseases, and weeds to determine their optimal growing environments. Combining IoT and big data analysis technology, real-time dynamic monitoring and warning systems can quickly respond once anomalies are detected. Together, these parts form a comprehensive framework for managing pests, diseases, and weeds, which helps increase crop yields and safeguard the ecological environment.
5. Pesticide Prescription Spraying Layer
The selection of pesticides, dose calculation, spraying time, and method are key factors in formulating prescriptions for pesticide spraying. These factors affect the economic efficiency of pesticide usage and relate to the sustainable management of the environment. By combining modern technologies such as geographic information, sensor technology, and computer vision, precision pesticide spraying can accurately manage different crops, pests, diseases, and weeds and their cycles of occurrence, thus achieving higher application efficiency and better ecological benefits.
5.1. The Relationship Between Plant Defense Mechanisms and IPPS
Plants have developed complex defense systems to resist pathogens, pests, and weeds over long periods of evolution. These mechanisms include physical, chemical, and induced defenses.
Physical defense means that the epidermal waxy layer [147,148], cuticle [149], and bark of plants can block the infestation of pathogens and insects. Some plants have thorns, spines, and prickles [150] that can physically stop herbivores from nibbling;
Chemical defense means that some plants produce chemicals such as alkaloids, terpenes, and phenols [151,152], which can poison or repel herbivorous insects. Some plants release VOCs when infested, attracting predators against herbivores [153];
Induced defense means that the whole plant activates defense mechanisms to increase resistance to the pathogen when a part of the plant is infested [154,155,156], known as systemic acquired resistance. In addition, plants transmit information through signaling molecules (e.g., jasmonic acid and salicylic acid) in the body to activate defense genes [157,158].
Based on crop growth and pest and weed infestation, etc., personalized prescriptions are developed. The main features include selecting pesticides according to the specific problems of the target, controlling the dose and spraying time precisely, reducing unnecessary use and cost, and reducing the environmental impact.
The relationship between plant defense mechanisms and IPPS is shown in Figure 7.
Plant defense mechanisms are the first line of defense, and studying these mechanisms can help develop resistant varieties and reduce pesticide dependence [159,160]. IPPS is a complementary tool to intervene when plant defenses are inadequate;
Understanding plant defense mechanisms can guide more information for IPPS decisions. For example, timely preventive application can be carried out by identifying the early signals of plant defense response;
Some pesticides can activate the plant’s defense mechanism, and reasonable IPPS can enhance the plant’s defense ability with some synergistic effect. Choosing the right spraying time and dosage can be combined with the plant’s natural defense response to improve the effectiveness of prevention and control;
Using plant defense mechanisms can reduce the usage of pesticides in the long term, which is conducive to the sustainable development of the agroecosystem. The combination of IPPS and defense mechanisms can lead to integrated pest management (IPM), which efficiently controls pests, diseases, and weeds while reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides and enhancing the natural defense capabilities of plants;
Excessive use of pesticides may interfere with normal plant defense mechanisms, and IPPS can minimize such interference.
The relationship between IPPS methods and plant defense mechanisms is dynamic and complex. A deeper understanding of precision agriculture prescription can help agricultural producers and researchers develop more effective and sustainable pest, disease, and weed management strategies. Combining targeted plants’ natural defenses with optimized pesticide application can achieve more precision, cost effectiveness, and environmentally friendly agricultural production.
5.2. Selection of Pesticide Formulations, Dose Calculation, and Usage Time
Different plant defense mechanisms may respond differently to different types of pesticides. The appropriate pesticide type selection is based on the specific defense mechanisms of the plant and the types of pests, diseases, and weeds [161]. If the plant relies mainly on induced defenses, selecting pesticides that activate these defense mechanisms may be necessary.
In order to achieve different efficacy, different pesticides need to be selected. Chemical insecticides were proven significantly more effective than biopesticides in a short timeframe. The efficacy period of biopesticides is significantly longer than that of chemical insecticides [162]. In addition, the environmental impact of the pesticides should be considered, and environmentally friendly and easily degradable pesticides should be selected as much as possible [38]. Long-term use of the same pesticide, leading to resistance to pests, diseases, and weeds, should also be avoided, and pesticides with different mechanisms of action should be rotated [163,164,165].
Precision pesticide spraying in agriculture involves precise control of the timing, method, dosage, and type of pesticide spraying. The recommended dosage in the pesticide instruction manual should be referred to first when arranging pesticide dosage. The dose can be adjusted according to the growth stage of the plant. Generally speaking, a lower dose is used in the early stage of plant growth and can be increased appropriately during the vigorous growth period [38]. The dose can be reduced when the pests, diseases, and weed infestation are mild. When serious, the dose must be increased, but it should not exceed the highest dose recommended in the pesticide instruction manual. Reducing the amount of pesticide used may be possible for varieties with greater resistance, thereby reducing environmental impact and costs. In addition, under unfavorable conditions such as high temperatures and drought, the amount of pesticides used should be appropriately reduced to minimize potential plant damage. In a word, the objective is to control pests, diseases, and weeds while simultaneously minimizing environmental damage [166].
The correct timing and methods of pesticide use are essential to ensure the pesticide’s effectiveness and minimize its impact on the environment [167].
Different pesticide spraying times affect where the pesticide goes and the amount of pesticide that leaches to the drains [168]. Different regions have different climatic gradients and field characteristics, so appropriate application times must be selected based on the field environment and local conditions [169,170]. In addition, pesticide spraying should avoid rainy or strong windy weather to reduce the loss and drift of the pesticide. Furthermore, high temperatures and strong sunlight may also affect the effectiveness of certain pesticides, so it is more appropriate to choose a cooler time in the morning or evening for pesticide spraying [170,171,172,173].
Understanding the life cycle of specific pests, diseases, and weeds is critical to determining the best application time. For example, when dealing with certain pests, the best time to apply may be when they are most active, so determining the best time to spray insecticides can ensure that pest populations are kept below economic loss levels [174]. On the other hand, for some diseases, the optimum time for pesticide spraying may be prior to the onset of the disease. For others, pesticide spraying may be required as soon as signs of the disease are detected.
Generative AI can assist in identifying the location and severity of pests, diseases, and weeds based on historical data and environmental parameters and choosing the most suitable pesticide while providing the optimal dose and usage timing.
5.3. Precautions for Pesticide Application
In order to use pesticides more accurately, efficiently, and sustainably, many precautions need to be taken.
Applicators should wear appropriate protective equipment, such as protective clothing, gloves, face masks, and goggles, to avoid direct contact with pesticides on the skin and in the eyes, and they should wash their hands and faces immediately after spraying. It is imperative that surplus pesticides and their packaging are disposed of appropriately. Furthermore, pesticide containers must not be used for any other purpose, and local regulations pertaining to pesticide waste disposal must be adhered to. Furthermore, gaining knowledge of first-aid procedures and familiarizing oneself with the details of emergency contacts is advisable. In addition, it is recommended to ensure the availability of water and soap in advance for washing after inadvertent contact;
It is inadvisable to undertake spraying operations during elevated pollinating insect activity, such as that observed in bees. In order to ensure the protection of non-target and beneficial organisms, due care must be exercised in this regard;
For some plants, pesticides can be applied directly to the plant roots through an irrigation system, which can improve the utilization of the pesticides [175,176], but root irrigation may pose a greater potential risk than spraying [177];
Pesticides can be injected directly into the plant for some large trees or specific crops to control pests or diseases. This method can significantly reduce the amounts of pesticides used and environmental pollution [178,179,180];
When two or more pesticides are mixed, there is a risk that their interactions may lead to reduced effectiveness or ineffectiveness. This is known as antagonism, which affects the control effect and may cause economic losses and environmental problems. For example, cyhalofop-butyl, a graminicide used to control rice postemergence weeds, is antagonized by some herbicides applied simultaneously [181]. In addition, spirodiclofen interacts with imidacloprid and appears antagonistic to the acaricidal effect of the Brevipalpus californicus when mixed [182]. Hence, pesticide spraying strategies should be adjusted according to the mechanism of pesticide resistance in pests, diseases, and weeds. Pesticides with different mechanisms of action should be rotated, or mixed spraying strategies should be used to slow down the development of resistance.
5.4. Pesticide Prescription Map
The core concept of pesticide spraying based on prescription maps is to use detailed spatial data to generate “prescription maps” that differentiate pesticide spraying according to the specific needs of different areas. The prescription map uses equipment (e.g., LiDAR, real-time kinematic, RTK, drones, etc.) to collect detailed data on a field or orchard, including topography, canopy characteristics, and vegetation conditions [183]. The collected data are converted into digital maps in GIS, which are analyzed by algorithms to generate 3D or 2D prescription maps for plant requirements in different regions. Differentiated pesticide spraying is carried out based on the prescription map. The pesticide spraying can be carried out using automated equipment (e.g., precision spraying drones [184] or self-driving tractors). During the application process, the spray volume and range are adjusted at any time through real-time data feedback and sensor monitoring to achieve the best results [185]. After pesticide spraying, the effect of pest control is evaluated through subsequent data collection and analysis to optimize the next round of application strategy.
The captured color images are first grayed, and then, the RGB model is converted to HSV. The maximum interclass variance method is used to perform dynamic threshold segmentation on the ultra-green feature gray-scale images to obtain the binary images of cotton and weeds, respectively. Then, the pesticide level and grid division are determined based on the weed center-of-mass coordinates and leaf area, and the prescription map is generated. The results of one study showed that a precision pesticide spraying system based on a prescription map can effectively improve pesticide utilization and reduce pesticide usage [186].
In areas with low plant vigor, the density of pest populations tends to be low as well, so a prescription map was designed to apply different dosages of insecticides in different areas according to the level of plant vigor to achieve the purpose of exterminating pests and reducing the number of insecticides at the same time [187].
By monitoring and analyzing the locust growing environment, the distribution of locusts can be analyzed and the distribution map adjusted according to the real-time status to create the locust infestation level zoning map. Then, combined with the actual situation of locust control in different regions, the aircraft precision prescription map of pesticide spraying and the ground precision prescription map of pesticide spraying, including the navigation track and variable pesticide spraying information, can achieve precise control of pesticide spraying over a large area and significantly reduce pesticide residue [188].
In one study, a mathematical model was established between crop canopy height and amount of pesticide spraying, the plant height information identified by LiDAR was transferred to the variable pesticide spraying system to generate the spray volume prescription map, and it was sent to the PWM controller, which changed the opening and closing of the solenoid valve in real time to change the spray volume, to achieve the purpose of precise variable pesticide spraying [189].
Overall, IPPS in agriculture effectively controls pests, diseases, and weeds through the integrated application of pesticide selection, dose calculation, and appropriate spraying time and method while minimizing the negative impact on the environment, greatly enhancing the effectiveness and utilization of pesticide use. At the same time, the use of GIS, sensor technology, automated equipment, and the application of UAVs, intelligent monitoring systems, and other modern tools to achieve differentiated precision pesticide spraying in different regions and plants will further improve the accuracy and efficiency of the pesticide spraying, significantly reducing the pollution of pesticides on the environment and waste. IPPS in agriculture will become a powerful driving force to promote the development of modern agriculture in a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and intelligent direction.
6. Implement and Control Layer
In the implement and control layer, navigation, positioning, automatic driving technology, precision spraying, and droplet characteristic control technology play an important role. Using navigation and positioning technology based on the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and automatic driving technology can realize efficient and accurate intelligent plant protection operations. Precision spraying technology optimizes the use of pesticides and fertilizers through advanced sensors and control systems to safeguard plant health and environmental safety. Meanwhile, droplet characteristic control technology improves pesticide spraying efficiency by controlling droplet size, density, and distribution.
6.1. Vehicle Automatic Control Technology
With minimal human intervention, vehicle automatic control technology uses advanced sensors, decision making, and control systems to enable various vehicles to autonomously complete tasks such as navigation, positioning, and autonomous driving. Among them, navigation and positioning technology mainly relies on GNSS, including the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United States [190], China’s BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), Russia’s Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) [191], and the European Union’s Galileo satellite navigation system (Galileo) [192]. Autonomous driving technologies, including driverless technologies, allow agricultural equipment to navigate and operate autonomously in the field. These technologies can provide precise geolocation information for agricultural machinery, allowing operating implements to follow predetermined paths and locations, reducing the need for manual operations and increasing the accuracy and efficiency of operations, thus enabling precise fertilizer, seeding, and pesticide spraying.
6.1.1. Accurate Positioning and Land Parcel Mapping
Navigation and positioning technology can provide precise geographic location information for every point within the farmland. High-precision positioning ensures that agricultural machinery can accurately reach the predetermined location, reducing the waste of pesticides and avoiding damage to non-target crops [193].
The precise mapping of plots is carried out using navigation and positioning technology to obtain precise boundaries, area, and topographic information and generate high-precision digital maps of the plots. These maps can be used to plan paths of pesticide spraying and ensure that the pesticide covers all areas to be treated [194].
6.1.2. Route Planning for Pesticide Application and Navigation Pesticide Spraying
Based on the mapping results, the spraying width of the application equipment, and the appropriate overlap, the optimal traveling path of the vehicle can be planned, and the design and management of the spraying strategy can be carried out by using GIS Pro 3.4 software in combination with GNSS data. This method not only adjusts the amounts of pesticides applied according to the specific conditions of the plot but also reduces the area of overlapped or missed spraying, thus improving the efficiency and accuracy of pesticide spraying [195,196]. A spraying vehicle equipped with navigation systems (e.g., UAVs, self-driving tractors, etc.) can spray pesticides precisely according to the designed application strategy, further ensuring accuracy and effectiveness [197,198].
6.1.3. Automated Driving and Obstacle Avoidance
The automated driving system uses navigation and positioning technology to ensure that the pesticide spraying equipment can automatically travel in the farmland according to the predetermined route. Combined with GIS-preset routes of pesticide spraying, the automated driving system can accurately control the farm machinery’s path to ensure that each crop receives the right amount of pesticide [199].
In addition, the pesticide spraying equipment is equipped with various sensors, such as radar, LiDAR, and cameras, which can monitor the surrounding environment in real time, automatically identify obstacles, and perform obstacle avoidance to ensure the safety of the pesticide application operation. Meanwhile, the system can also monitor the working status of the equipment and the amount of pesticide applied in real time to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the application operation.
6.2. Precise Spraying Technology
The technologies of variable-rate spraying, profiling spraying, targeting spraying, and anti-drift spraying all fall under the category of IPPS technology. All these technologies aim to optimize the use of pesticides or other agrochemicals by improving spraying precision, increasing crop yield, ensuring healthy plant growth, and reducing resource wastage and environmental pollution. The development timeline from hand sprayer to intelligent spraying technologies is shown in Figure 8.
6.2.1. Variable-Rate Spraying
Variable-rate spraying technology adapts spray volumes and strategies to suit different regions’ specific needs by monitoring target plant and soil conditions in real time [200,201]. This technology usually relies on advanced sensors, GNSS, and GIS systems to precisely control the spray volume to ensure that each area receives the optimal amount of pesticides it needs.
6.2.2. Profiling Spraying
Profiling spraying is a technology that automatically adjusts the height of the spray boom in response to changes in plant height or terrain to maintain an optimal distance between the spraying nozzle and the target plant or ground [202,203]. This ensures uniform spray coverage and reduces pesticide drift, increasing spraying efficiency and reducing environmental impact.
6.2.3. Targeting Spraying
Targeting technology focuses on accurately identifying crops and weeds and spraying only the plants that need to be treated [204,205]. This technique usually combines image recognition and AI algorithms and can significantly reduce the pesticides used while protecting the crop from non-targeted spraying.
6.2.4. Anti-Drift Spraying
Anti-drift spraying reduces drift during spraying by improving the nozzle design of droplet drift control, adjusting droplet size, and optimizing spray parameters. This technology ensures the sprayed pesticide reaches the target area more accurately, reducing the impact on the surrounding environment and non-target crops [206,207,208,209].
The effectiveness of different intelligent spraying technology is shown in Table 3.
6.3. Droplet Characteristic Control Technology
The control technology of droplet characteristics is of great significance for improving the application efficiency of agricultural chemical pesticides, reducing environmental pollution, and protecting plant health. Droplet size, density, and distribution directly affect pesticides’ coverage, penetration capacity, and evaporation loss. Therefore, precise control of droplet characteristics can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of agricultural production.
6.3.1. Key Elements of Droplet Characteristic Control Technology
Droplet diameter is a key factor in deposition rate and coverage. Smaller droplets can improve coverage but are also more susceptible to drifting due to wind, increasing the potential risk to the surrounding environment. Therefore, choosing the right droplet size ensures the effectiveness of spraying and reduces the environmental impact [213,214,215,216].
Droplet deposition density refers to the number of droplets per unit area, directly affecting the pesticide’s uniform distribution and action effect. Appropriate deposition density helps to ensure the effective concentration of pesticides on the foliage of crops and avoid wastage or harm of the pesticide.
Droplet distribution uniformity refers to the concentration or dispersion of droplet distribution, which can be expressed by the relative spectral width, diffusion ratio, and coefficient of variation. Uniform droplet distribution can ensure that each crop can obtain enough pesticide coverage to improve the control effect.
The skewness of the droplet distribution describes the symmetry of the droplet size distribution, and the droplet distribution’s kurtosis describes the droplet distribution’s sharpness and the tail’s thickness [217]. The performance of the pesticide spraying system and the spraying effect can be assessed by analyzing the kurtosis and skewness of the droplet distribution. For example, a droplet size distribution close to normal (low kurtosis and skewness close to zero) may be desirable for applications requiring uniform droplet coverage.
6.3.2. Traditional Droplet Control Technology
Droplet size and spray pattern can be adjusted by improving the design of the nozzle, for example, by using different nozzle shapes, sizes, and materials. Adjusting the operating pressure of the spray equipment can also change the droplet size and spray rate. Specific surfactants or other additives can change the surface tension of the liquid, which affects droplet formation and size.
Hydrodynamic atomization is squeezing a liquid under high pressure through one or more small orifices (nozzles) to form droplets. The droplet diameter can be adjusted by varying parameters such as nozzle size, supply pressure, and the nature of the liquid. In particular, the pressure of the liquid as it passes through the nozzle can be varied by adjusting the pump’s output pressure or by using a pressure regulating valve [218]. Usually, the higher the liquid pressure, the smaller the generated droplets [205]. The hydraulic atomization nozzle is simple in structure [219], easy to use, and inexpensive, and it is widely used for pesticide spraying. However, hydrodynamic atomization has certain requirements on the viscosity and other physical properties of the liquid, and the obtained droplet size distribution range is wide [220], which may not meet the requirements of fine spraying to dynamically adjust the droplet diameter.
6.3.3. Smart Droplet Control Technology
Piezoelectric ultrasonic atomization uses the inverse piezoelectric effect of a piezoelectric ceramic to generate mechanical vibrations under the action of an electric field [221]. When vibration frequency becomes excessive, it is transmitted to the liquid in contact with it, and the liquid is atomized into tiny droplets via the cavitation effect [222] or the surface wave effect [223]. Figure 9 shows a schematic diagram of an ultrasonic atomizer consisting of a sandwich transducer and a variable amplitude rod. Adjusting the vibration frequency and power of the ultrasonic waves allows the droplet diameter to be dynamically and continuously regulated within a certain range. The higher the frequency, the smaller the droplets produced [224], and the higher the power, the higher the atomization efficiency [225]. Piezoelectric ultrasonic atomization can produce micron/sub-micron droplets [226]; for aqueous pesticides such as low-viscosity liquids, ultrasonic atomization produces droplets with particle sizes usually in the range of 1–100 μm, with narrow droplet size distributions, good uniformity, and relatively low energy consumption. However, the cost of piezoelectric ultrasonic atomization equipment is high, and the physical and chemical properties of the liquid have certain requirements; some solutions are not suitable for ultrasonic atomization. In addition, prolonged operation may lead to overheating of the piezoelectric ceramic, reducing the service life;
Gas-assisted atomization allows the liquid to meet the high-speed gas flow in the nozzle or atomization device and use the gas’s shear force, turbulence effect, or pressure difference to atomize the liquid into tiny droplets [227]. The breakup and refinement of the droplets during the atomization process can be controlled by adjusting parameters such as the gas flow rate and pressure [228] as well as the liquid flow rate and pressure [229], enabling the regulation of the droplet diameter. Higher gas flow rates or pressures usually produce smaller droplets [230];
Centrifugal atomizing nozzles utilize a rotating atomizing disk (or rotating wheel or rotating cage) to allow liquid delivered to the center of the high-speed rotating disk to be thrown outwards from the center by centrifugal force and form droplets as it leaves the edge [215]. Adjustment of the diameter of the droplets can be achieved by adjusting the rotational speed of the atomizing disk [231] and by replacing the atomizing disk [232] with different numbers of teeth. Taken together, centrifugal atomization can produce droplets in the range of a dozen microns to about a hundred microns, covering a fairly wide range of diameters, and it is difficult to reach the submicron level yet. The atomization of liquids using a rotating disk is easy to operate, does not require external pressure or gas flow, and can handle large quantities of liquids [233]. Therefore, centrifugal atomization is widely used in aerial pesticide applications [234]. However, the droplet size mainly depends on the rotational speed, resulting in a limited adjustment range of droplet diameter [235];
Electrostatic atomization is when a charged liquid in a high-voltage electrostatic field is subjected to a combination of surface tension, gravity, and electrostatic force, resulting in an extremely unstable droplet surface and splitting into droplets. The size and distribution of the droplets can be controlled by adjusting the voltage. Higher voltages typically produce smaller, more uniformly distributed droplets. Electrostatic atomization techniques can also be used to adjust the direction of flight and distribution range of the droplets by changing the layout of the electric field.
Combined navigation, positioning, automatic driving technologies, precision spraying technologies, and droplet characteristic control technologies represent the frontiers of modern precision agriculture. By providing precise location information, intelligent operation path planning, and efficient pesticide spraying strategies, these technologies greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of agricultural production and reduce resource waste and environmental pollution. Precise plot mapping and path planning of pesticide spraying ensures comprehensive coverage of farmland management, while automated driving and obstacle avoidance technologies ensure operational safety and flexibility. Meanwhile, variable rate spraying technology and profile spraying technology for different plant needs and soil conditions further optimize the use of agricultural resources. Through modern droplet characteristic control technology, agricultural producers can apply pesticides more scientifically, significantly improving the quality and efficiency of agricultural production. With the continuous development of technology, these precision agriculture technologies will continue to promote the development of agriculture in the direction of high efficiency, intelligence, and environmental protection and make an important contribution to the sustainable development of global agriculture.
7. Research Prospects
With global climate change and the growing demand for agricultural production, pest, disease, and weed control faces enormous challenges. Traditional control methods can no longer meet modern agricultural production’s efficiency, environmental protection, and sustainable development needs. Therefore, developing key technologies for IPPS has become an important measure to solve this problem. IPPS systems can achieve early identification, precise positioning, and personalized control of pests, diseases, and weeds, which not only improves the control efficiency and effectiveness but also greatly reduces the use of pesticides and the impact on the environment. In addition, intelligent data analysis and decision support can provide scientific and reasonable prevention and control suggestions for agricultural production, further improving the intelligent level of agricultural production.
However, the implementation of IPPS technology faces significant challenges across multiple domains. Data collection and quality assurance have persistent issues with field data accuracy, reliability, and consistency, particularly when dealing with diverse environmental conditions and multi-source data integration. The information processing capabilities are currently limited by inadequate model generalization and inefficient real-time processing of diverse pest and disease data. Additionally, the system faces considerable challenges in prescription generation and decision support, including difficulties in developing personalized treatment plans and integrating multiple data sources for effective decision making. Implementation and control aspects also present significant hurdles, particularly in achieving precise variable flow spraying operations and maintaining consistent droplet characteristics during application.
In the future, with the continuous integration and application of advanced technologies such as AI, big data, IoT, remote sensing, etc., pest, disease, and weed control will usher in a revolutionary change. All kinds of target information acquisition technology, information processing technology, and implement and control technology in spraying technology for plant protection will be deeply integrated with intelligent agriculture and prescription agriculture, and a new IPPS system will be constructed by further overcoming the weak links at each technical level. In contrast, a new intelligent plant protection platform construction will be built with the rapid development of the internet and big data technology. Here, we put forward the development outlooks of the key technologies of IPPS for pest, disease, and weed control in the future from four perspectives:
At the target information acquisition layer, information acquisition systems should be studied based on the characteristics of pests, diseases, and weeds: research on a multiple information acquisition system that uses low-altitude UAVs carrying remote sensing platforms, image acquisition systems, acoustic wave sensors, and other fusion technologies to comprehensively collect information on plant victimization data; research on a system that can instantly detect the situation of plant infestation, real-time access to the growth status of plants at different times through target information acquisition technology, construction of agricultural big data, and comparing the growth characteristics of the target plants in the monitoring area with those of healthy plants to analyze the severity of the influence of pesticide damage; research on establishing the standardized data collection protocols and quality control systems; and research on developing the real-time data validation and error correction algorithms;
At the information processing layer, a multi-task recognition model of pests, diseases, and weeds is required as well as research on building a decision-making model for IPPS that can identify the positioning of pests, diseases, and weeds in a certain area at the same time; research on the integrated classification of the positioning model of pests, diseases, and weeds, training the model with the collected image data of diseases, pests, and weeds to improve its generalization ability and achieve multi-functionality to realize multifunctional identification tasks to reduce equipment expenditure and additional agricultural equipment operating time; research on generative AI for the generation of a large number of images and spectral data of pests, diseases, and weeds for continuous model improvement; and research on deploying efficient real-time processing algorithms with quality assurance mechanisms;
At the pesticide prescription spraying layer, a decision-support system should be built based on generative AI for the prescription of pests, diseases, and weeds: using ground-based IoT combined with UAVs and satellite remote sensing to achieve all-weather access to agricultural information; building a database of historical disaster information, historical weather, and environmental information, and pest, and weed, and pesticide types; uploading relative information to the global agricultural information sharing platform to promote global cooperation and localized strategy optimization; building a dynamic ecological model based on generative AI and a prescription generation system for IPPS by learning a large amount of pest, disease, and weed data and control methods; creating virtual models with generative AI to simulate the farmland environment and the development process of pests, diseases, and weeds in response to possible disaster situations for researchers or farmers to observe the control effects of different control strategies and the ecological impacts and to give personalized prescriptions for novel pesticide combinations; integrating multi-source data fusion from ground IoT, UAVs, and satellites; and enabling personalized prescription recommendations with uncertainty quantification;
At the implement and control layer, IPPS machinery should be developed: breaking through the existing crop canopy area based on the technical bottleneck of variable flow spraying operations as well as developing and profiling and targeting intelligent machinery that can achieve real-time variable flow, variable pressure for a different range, and variable spray direction based on plant varieties, densities, and types and locations of pests, diseases, and weeds under the condition of a constant droplet size.
In conclusion, the future development of IPPS technology for pest, disease, and weed control will be multidimensional and comprehensive. At the same time, policy support, interdisciplinary cooperation, and public awareness are also important factors in promoting the development of this technology, which will greatly promote the development of agricultural production in the direction of more efficient, environmentally friendly, and sustainable development and make an important contribution to global food security and ecological, environmental protection.

Re: Contribute to shaping the design of the Agrifood System Technologies & Innovations Outlook (ATIO) Knowledge Base

ATIO (Agrifood System Technologies and 
Innovations Outlook) Knowledge Bases – 
Concept Note 
Draft – Confidential – December 2024 - To be used only for consultations with stakeholders  
I. Context 
The strategic use of Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) is pivotal for transforming agrifood 
systems (AFS) and achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. The FAO Science & 
Innovation Strategy (1 ) highlights the importance of supporting innovation and technology at 
regional and country level (Pillar 2), with special emphasis on "access to, and use of, inclusive, 
sustainable, affordable and context specific innovations and technologies by small-scale producers", 
and related capacities of national agrifood innovation systems to prioritize and scale them. The 
Strategy also recognizes the importance of tapping into local knowledge and indigenous processes of 
experimentation and innovation. Furthermore, the Strategy emphasizes the importance of enhancing 
FAO's capabilities to better serve its Members States in leveraging science and innovations for their 
development needs.  
The Strategy also recognizes the importance of tapping into local knowledge and indigenous processes 
of experimentation and innovation. This contributes to Action 32 of the Summit for the Future2: "We 
will protect, build on and complement Indigenous, traditional and local knowledge. We recognize the 
need for science, technology and innovation to be adapted and made relevant to local needs and 
circumstances, including for local communities, traditional Afro-descendent populations, and 
Indigenous Peoples, in line with the principle of free, prior and informed consent, as appropriate. We 
decide to: (a) Foster synergies between science and technology and traditional, local, Afrodescendent 
and Indigenous knowledge, systems, practices and capacities." 
To fulfill its supporting role, FAO proposes the creation of new knowledge products, intended to 
provide end-to-end life cycle coverage of AFS technologies and innovations for evidence-based 
decision making by policy makers, investors, innovators and potential adopters. The knowledge 
products will together constitute the Agrifood Systems Technologies and Innovations Outlook (ATIO), 
a new outlook focused on understanding better the level of uptake of technologies and innovations. 
The envisioned ATIO knowledge products include a biennial publication, featuring scientifically vetted 
analyses and foresight studies across the full life cycle of AFS STI, and the ATIO Knowledge Bases (KBs), 
integrating and curating high-quality data that track AFS STI. The term Knowledge Bases in the plural 
refers in turn to two products: the overall catalog of innovations (the ATIO KB), and a catalog of 
Grassroots innovations (the ATIO Grassroots Innovations KB, shorter form: Grassroots KB), which can 
be seen both as a subset of the general catalog and as a separate product, which will have its own 
landing page. The backbone of the KBs will be the same, and they could either be searched together 
or separately or both. When using the singular ATIO KB we refer to the whole KB including the 
1FAO. 2022. FAO Science and Innovation Strategy. Rome. 
2https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/sotf-pact_for_the_future_adopted.pdf 
1  
Grassroots KB; when we use the plural, we emphasize the fact that the Grassroots KB will be also a 
standalone product. 
This Concept Note describes the ATIO KB as a whole, including the Grassroots KB. A separate Concept 
Note will be developed to explain in more detail the objectives and implementation modalities of the 
Grassroots KB. 
As mentioned, the ATIO KB is part of the ATIO initiative, and it will be hosted in the FAO Science, 
Technology and Innovation (STI) portal. The diagram below clarifies the relations with the two 
initiatives. 
Fig 2. The ATIO KB in the context of the ATIO initiative and the STI portal. 
II. Rationale and overall concept 
The overall rationale for the ATIO KB coincides of course with that of the broader ATIO initiative: in 
short, the limited uptake of STI in LMICs due to issues like technology appropriateness, accessibility, 
and capacities. The idea behind ATIO is to address this problem by providing an outlook that helps 
policy makers, investors, innovation users and innovators make better decisions and promote / adopt 
solutions that are appropriate (accessible, context-specific, profitable, sustainable), and therefore 
increase the uptake of STI. 
The more specific rationale for setting up the KBs lies in the following needs:  
a) ATIO biennial publications will report the results of a horizon scanning of technologies and 
innovations which in turn will inform a foresight analysis, also part of the same publication. To 
produce such an evidence-based outlook publication biennially, FAO and the ATIO partners 
need to monitor, and make sense of, up-to-date information on technologies and innovations, 
and there is no information system that can directly support such an effort, so one should be 
built, with the functionalities to scan the agrifood innovations ecosystem regularly, store and 
structure the results, and analyze them.   
2  
Since ATIO wants to look at the whole life cycle of innovations and across the full spectrum of 
stakeholders - with special attention to gaps, like pre-emergent innovations and Grassroots 
innovations - it needs a system that can scan the horizon also for alternative sources of 
information and can leverage crowdsourcing from Grassroots organizations. 
b) Beyond the biennial publication that will provide selected insights, there is a need for a 
regularly updated, always available catalog that the prospective users can consult at any time 
to derive their own insights and to make better decisions towards more appropriate solutions. 
c) The need for a single-entry point for data that is relevant for the management of science, 
technology and innovations in the context of AFS.  
Nothing that can fulfill the above needs exists, at the necessary scale and with the information 
necessary to assess the appropriateness of innovations for a specific context and the potential for 
uptake. Data and analyses on AFS STI are limited and broadly scattered, difficult to synthetize and 
hence complex to put into use. Not only are there very few sources of structured data of this type, but 
even across all structured and unstructured sources, there are fundamental gaps:  - - - - - 
Even knowledge generated by formal research programs - which is the most readily available - is fragmented, incomplete and not always annotated with the same level of detail and for the 
same purposes. 
Information on Grassroots innovations and informal experimentation led by farmers, by NGOs 
or by other innovation actors is much less available, and it is difficult to even identify suitable 
types of sources. 
The ambition is to cover the whole life cycle, but Information on pre-emergent innovations is 
very hard to find and may even not surface in that phase. 
In general, existing sources lack fundamental contextual data or metadata to assess the 
readiness, adoptability and effective application of innovations to concrete use. 
A few specialized platforms may provide more advanced contextual information, but they only 
have partial coverage (institutional, regional, thematic), while ATIO has a global scope. 
These acknowledgements gain more significance considering the increasingly recognized need for 
more localized, practical and applied knowledge. The new hallmark of quality assurance, as recognized 
also by the evolving criteria of assessment of research quality by the CGIAR, depends on local relevance 
and legitimacy of knowledge generation processes that incorporate negotiation and consensus 
building with different actors of innovation and increased social accountability, built on new multi
stakeholder collaborations as well as wider social networks and coalitions. 
The lack of structured data and the limitations of currently available data to satisfy the complex 
knowledge needs identified above provide the rationale for the creation of the ATIO KB:  
The ATIO KB is a global, neutral, partnership-driven, participatory, both federated 
and crowdsourced, open access knowledge base providing end-to-end life cycle 
coverage of AFS technologies and innovations across the full spectrum of 
stakeholders, including grassroots innovations. The KB provides structured and 
purposefully annotated presentations of innovations, holistically documenting 
dimensions that allow policy makers, investors, innovators and innovation users to 
assess their appropriateness in specific contexts and their potential uptake. 
This will help policy makers, funders and innovators to identify investment/research areas and gaps, 
and innovation users to identify technologies or other forms of innovations that can improve 
livelihoods and contribute to development. 
3  
III. Goal and Objectives  
The ATIO KB shares the same goal of the overall ATIO initiative, including the ATIO strategic publication.  
Regarding the ATIO KB, its specific objective is to assist policy makers and other agrifood stakeholders 
in making informed decisions to support the prioritization and upscaling of sciences, technologies and 
innovations to accelerate agrifood systems transformation.  
IV. Target audience and users 
The ATIO KB aims to provide relevant information on technologies and innovations to the following 
audiences, at national as well as at international level: - - - - 
decision makers, for policy formulation and investments planning; 
producers, through their organizations, for awareness as well as assessment of relevance; 
researchers and innovators in general, for identifying gaps and areas in which to further 
advance the knowledge available;  
agripreneurs from the private sector, for identifying trends and needs.  
The knowledge on innovations available through the platform will be tailored for these users, and 
therefore provide information (and categorizations) on aspects like stage of development, readiness, 
“adoptability”, specific use case (e.g. production or marketing), accessibility etc. 
V. Added Value 
The added value of the ATIO KB lies primarily in its holistic approach covering the many dimensions of 
innovation generation and uptake, its partnership-based federated and crowdsourcing model, its 
global coverage, quality of the information and underlying quality assurance processes, and creation 
of opportunities and spaces for beneficial data sharing among relevant stakeholders and agencies. 
More in detail, the combination of the following interconnected approaches will make it a unique and 
much needed resource: 
a) Holistic approach to STI generation and uptake: The information will be gathered, curated 
and presented in a way that represents the complexity of the many dimensions of technology 
and innovation generation and uptake, and all the factors that can determine how adoptable 
a solution is in a specific context. Features covered will go from design and implementation 
approaches to accessibility, readiness level, cultural acceptability and the like; they will include 
information to assess impact in terms of regulatory, ethical, gender, and environmental issues. 
The information architecture will be designed in function of this holistic approach: the record 
structure and the classification system will reflect this multi-dimensional view of STI, enabling 
the extraction of holistic insights.  
b) Partnership-based data gathering: The ATIO KB will federate different existing data sources 
from different providers (investment banks, research centers and universities, international 
organizations3, NGOs, networks of innovation actors, etc.) and will use crowdsourcing when 
appropriate, like for the Grassroots KB, which intends to capture information on innovations 
and technologies that is not typically available through formal/web-based sources . Federation 
and crowdsourcing will be performed based on agreements and partnerships in which all 
3Special agreements and partnerships will be established with FAO’s initiatives that have a similar objective or 
scope but differ in coverage/scale or audience, like the FAO AgriTech Observatory for the ECA region, or the 
Digital Impact Exchange initiative. 
4  
actors benefit. This will help ensure that the ATIO KB is not perceived as a competitor but 
rather as a complement and a visibility opportunity. And it will make the platform more 
sustainable. 
c) Crowdsourcing for grassroots innovations: The ATIO KB also aims at scouting, identifying, and 
recognizing farmer-led innovations: a subset of the KB will be devoted to grassroots 
innovations, mainly crowdsourced in collaboration with producers’ and indigenous people’s 
organizations. This subset will be accessible through a separate dedicated landing page, as a 
standalone "Grassroots KB", and possibly also searchable through the main ATIO KB.. 
d) Interaction and learning loops: The ATIO KB will support interactive curation by innovation 
users, with constants updates/refinements of the descriptions of innovations/technologies 
resulting from new knowledge acquired in their application. This will help ensure that the ATIO 
KB contains up-to-date and relevant information. Introducing new knowledge and identifying 
innovations on which to build will also enable learning and innovation loops. 
e) Holistic and investment-sensitive indicators: from the dimensions above, contributing to a 
holistic view of innovations, interesting indicators can be defined and calculated (e.g. average 
level of accessibility of solutions produced or used in a country).  
In addition, dimensions covered will include information to assess impact in terms of climate 
change and environmental issues, highlighting also possibly competing dimensions (e.g. 
environmental impact and profitability, cultural acceptance and improved productivity...) as 
well as gender, minorities and general regulatory and ethical issues. From these additional 
dimensions, interesting indicators can be defined and calculated, some of which in areas of 
high investments, like climate change.  
f) 
Neutrality and FAO's unique position: The fact that FAO oversees the project ensures 
neutrality and leverages FAO's unique position to influence policy. In addition, concerning the 
Grassroots KB, FAO hosts the Family Farming Knowledge Platform, with contributors including 
Governments, United Nations Agencies, Farmers’ Organizations, Research centers and 
Academia: this community can help create initial critical mass. 
VI What it is and how it works 
A Knowledge Base4 is a searchable catalog especially built for knowledge extraction. A KB leverages an 
information model and a semantic backbone that represent the domain and enable reasoning 
mechanisms for extraction of insights as well as creation of new knowledge. 
ATIO is a KB providing structured and semantically enhanced information on innovations for AFS. This 
information will be for the major part harvested or scraped from existing data sources under special 
agreements, and for another part (the Grassroots KB) crowdsourced. The ingestion process includes 
an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted algorithm that identifies information on relevant innovations in 
the data sources and categorizes the identified innovation against the ATIO classifications system. A 
4A Knowledge Base "represents facts about the world and ways of reasoning about those facts to deduce new 
facts or highlight inconsistencies" (Wikipedia). According to Oxford languages, it is “the underlying set of facts, 
assumptions, and rules which a computer system has available to solve a problem”. According to Ontotext, 
“Knowledge bases add a semantic model to the data, which includes a formal classification with classes, 
subclasses, relationships and instances (ontologies and dictionaries), on one hand, and rules for interpreting 
the data, on the other”. 
5  
human approval and curation process is foreseen, by which all harvested data will go into a staging 
repository and will be published only after approval. Manual curation will happen both in the staging 
step and after publication, also leveraging partnerships, to ensure data quality.  
Fig. 1 – Data gathering and curation in the ATIO KB 
The ATIO semantic backbone will be made of two semantic artifacts: a data-driven taxonomy or 
knowledge map representing the landscape of agri-food systems innovations, resulting from AI
assisted harvesting of content from highly relevant sources, and a system of classifications semi
automatically generated from the knowledge map (aligned with those used in similar efforts by FAO 
and partners) to cover all the necessary dimensions relevant to the holistic approach of ATIO. These 
classifications will be used to categorize all innovations.  All the relations between the innovations and 
the categories, and between the categories themselves, will be exposed openly in a “knowledge 
graph”. 
The interface will allow browsing and filtering through the classifications and free-text search. Special 
functions for inferring more advanced relations and extracting insights will be made available. The 
ATIO KB public interface will be made available inside the FAO STI Portal interface. 
Two key aspects of ATIO need to be described more in detail: the way the information architecture is 
designed to serve the holistic approach described above, and the partnership-driven approach 
enabling fair and transparent data flows both for the aggregation and the crowdsourcing of data. 
VI.i Information architecture for a holistic view of innovations 
Most available databases on innovations emphasize the description on the technical, bio-physical or 
digital aspects of the solutions developed, with little or no data / metadata on aspects that are key to 
the assessment of the solutions as well as to the clustering and data analysis that ATIO needs, like 
sustainability, or the specific socio-economic adoption circumstances of the solutions proposed, or 
capacities required, or readiness. 
The information architecture of the ATIO KB will instead be designed primarily with these readiness 
and uptake-related dimensions in mind, in function of the scope of ATIO and its holistic approach. 
6  
The information architecture of the ATIO KB will be driven by a special content model that will be 
validated in consultations. A content model consists of two main components: the structure of the 
records describing the main entities (in the case of ATIO, the technology/innovation “profile” or 
metadata model) and the “knowledge organization systems”, like the taxonomies / classifications that 
will make filtering and browsing possible. This will constitute the semantic backbone of the ATIO KB. 
The technology/innovation “profile” will define the "fields” / metadata elements for the different 
properties that characterize the innovation. Examples of fields that will be in the innovation profile are 
name, description, purpose, partners, funding, methodology, inclusive aspects, information for putting 
the innovation into use, examples of adoption, capacities required, environmental sustainability, 
sustainability over time - more narrative fields - as well as "categorical” fields, for example for type of 
innovation, use case, readiness level and all the dimensions that will be used for filtering and browsing 
(categorical fields are fields for which values have to be selected from a list of categories, which are 
then used for filtering and browsing the records in the KB), The profile will be designed based on a use 
case analysis to ensure that the included information responds to critical interests by relevant agrifood 
system stakeholders, policy makers, and agrifood entrepreneurs.   
Innovations’ profiles will be viewable and downloadable as short documents, including pictures and 
boxes to clearly explain and visualize the context, as well as exportable in machine-readable formats. 
One interesting example of unique metadata elements in the ATIO KB are the possible qualifying 
dimensions to help identify adoptable solutions, like: readiness, appropriateness, scalability, 
participatory nature, partnerships. The “adoptability” quality combines several dimensions, which 
need to be captured in dedicated fields in the innovation profile, for instance: 
• Profitability: clear indication of the benefits of the innovation and for whom, in terms of tangible 
advantages such as increased yields, stability, resilience, incomes, etc. or non-tangible benefits in 
terms of human, social and natural capital, with specific reference to the socio-economic status of 
the potential users/adopters; 
• Accessibility: material availability of the technology/innovation and/or its required 
complementary inputs and related affordability for the rural poor. 
• Acceptability: this dimension is related to the potential changes and even disruptions the 
widespread adoption of the technology/innovation may imply if introduced in the farming and 
social system, including redistribution of labor, land tenure arrangements, mental representations 
and mindsets, etc.5 
• Sustainability: this dimension can be appreciated on the basis of information to be collected on 
the degree of meaningful involvement of farmers in the definition and implementation of the main 
experimental steps that led to the outputs and hence their capacity to further refine the 
technology/innovation. 
• Co-development: (relevant for the two previous dimensions) the degree to which innovations 
have been developed through several stages of adaptive research, farmer-led experimentation 
and trials and peer review. 
• Further research needed: it is important to provide elements that can highlight the supplementary 
areas of investigation required to address the above points and hence strengthen the 
appropriateness and adoptability of the technology/innovations. 
5This aspect is critical to guide in the design of institutional and policy reforms that might be needed to 
enhance the technology's adoption and the innovation's scalability.  
7  
Some of these dimensions could also be captured in categorical fields to facilitate filtering and 
browsing. The values for these fields will come from the taxonomies described below. 
The knowledge organization systems (taxonomies, classifications etc.) are the second component of 
the content model and will be partly generated with AI-assisted routines and partly designed in 
consultation with the potential ATIO KB partners, including FAO technical divisions6. 
The guiding principle is that, both for harmonization purposes and for not reinventing the wheel, 
relevant knowledge organization systems or semantic structures that already exist (classifications / 
taxonomies, ontologies, thesauri etc.) should be reused or aligned to. However, innovation is a new 
area, and no dedicated universally recognized taxonomies exist for specific dimensions of innovations; 
it's also quickly evolving, and taxonomies like innovation type or use cases would need regular revisions 
based on changing realities. Hence the idea of a data-driven semantic structure, an innovation 
taxonomy or knowledge map representing the landscape of agri-food systems innovations, resulting 
from AI-assisted harvesting of content from highly relevant sources. On the one hand, the knowledge 
map will be used directly for graph-based browsing. On the other hand, depending on how broad it 
will be and how many dimensions it will cover, it will also be used to validate, enrich and update smaller 
homogenous curated classifications, each covering one dimension (type, use case, sector...).  
Classifications beyond the data-driven taxonomy will be partly fed by the data-driven one but will be 
manually curated to make sure that a) they include terms from and align to existing classifications or 
even local categorization systems of similar partner efforts, for harmonization purposes; and b) they 
are agreed upon by stakeholders.   
Classifications will be used to categorize Innovations considering holistically the different interests and 
perspectives of the users and the different angles under which innovations can be considered. Typical 
useful categories to filter innovations would be: type, use case, development stage, readiness, 
different aspects of the envisaged use (crops, animal species, farming practices, climatic areas, soil 
types), value chain step; other interesting less conventional categories can be: accessibility features, 
components of a production process to which the innovation applies (such as a variety or a weed 
control practice), the complete production process (such as apiculture or aquaculture), a bundle of 
innovations addressing a broad challenge/initiative to which the innovation belongs (for example the 
Great Green Wall, soil and water conservation, etc.). Different domains - technological, social, 
institutional, economic, political – will be considered.  
Terminology resources like glossaries or small thesauri may also be produced, to clarify the terms, 
since this is a domain in which standards haven’t been established yet. And an alignment with 
established vocabularies (like AGROVOC) is desirable for interoperability purposes. ATIO could provide 
a terminology service for innovations which evolves based on the reality of the ATIO KB. 
Classifications are also important to define the scope and the semantic framework for AI-assisted 
procedures: in order to identify new potential sources, but also new relevant content in existing 
sources, it is foreseen that AI will be used: in this scenario, classifications can support AI in a semi
supervised approach to text mining. 
VI.ii A partnership-driven federated and crowdsourced KB  
An effort like the ATIO KB cannot be run by one actor that in isolation creates and curates a catalog 
from scratch. Some platforms exist that, though partially or under a different perspective, whether in 
6Alignment with similar efforts like the FAO AgriTech Observatory for Europe and Central Asia and 
harmonization efforts in FAO are already foreseen. 
8  
a structured or unstructured way, already have useful information that only needs to be found, 
retrieved and systematized. Data will be federated from sources identified either through the 
partnerships in place, or through scanning of the web. An initial set of sources has been identified for 
a prototype. Partnerships or agreements with the providers of these services will be put in place. 
In addition, for many Grassroots innovations that will most probably not be in any existing catalog, 
partnerships with Grassroots organizations will be put in place to be able to crowdsource information 
directly from them. 
The data sourcing – both the federation and the crowdsourcing approach - will be inspired by the 
principle of win-win collaboration between contributors, avoiding any “extractive” type of 
relationship. It shall be based on agreements to be established within the overall framework and 
philosophy of ATIO with the different databases’ owners/managers. The collaboration should be 
aligned with the overall purpose of the ATIO knowledge base creation and serve also the purpose of 
the partners. Benefits for the partners will be identified on a case-by-case basis and can go from simple 
visibility to demonstration of impact to the improvement of their own systems. 
VII. Strategic partners and their role (UN and non-UN) 
Different levels of partnerships and functions will need to be identified, and can be combined: 
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
iv) 
Partners providing access to their own existing databases or websites. 
Partners who directly contribute to the content (e.g. organizations contributing to the 
Grassroots KB through crowdsourcing). 
Partners who support technical aspects of the platform. 
Sponsors who fund and promote the platform. 
VIII. Governance and management of the knowledge base  
Governance structure 
In order to avoid a proliferation of governing bodies, the same governing bodies will oversee ATIO and 
the ATIO KB: the ATIO Technical Advisory Committee. In addition, the ATIO KB will be more closely 
monitored and coordinated by a Technical Committee (TC).   
The TC will include the partners mentioned in chapter VI above, plus representatives from 
implementing teams (OIN, CSI and ESS in FAO, plus external implementing partners). Terms and roles 
can vary depending on the individual partner agreements, but as a matter of principle all partners 
agreeing to make their data reusable by the ATIO KB or contributing data directly should be offered a 
seat in the CT. Other experts can support the TC with technical advice.  
The ATIO governance body will monitor progress, performance and extent of achievement of the 
objectives of the KB, while the TC will oversee all technical aspects and prepare reports, proposals of 
new partnerships and work plans.   
TC members will be encouraged, depending on their partnership agreements, to provide in-kind 
support to content-related and technical activities.  
Data governance and fairness  
The ATIO KB is conceived as part of a more substantial transformation of the modalities of knowledge 
production based on fair and equal power relationships among actors.  
9  
The data gathered on technologies and innovations will be collected in the framework of a partnership 
which will be forged between FAO/OIN and the data provider in the federating case, or the contributing 
partner in the crowdsourcing case. The partnership agreement will establish the “rules of the game”, 
including data rights, as part of a common objective.  
Any research which will be fed by this data and will feed these data will use it according to the data 
use agreement, which will be respectful of all the actors that generated it - including and empowering 
them at all steps of the innovation process: this data use agreement is an example of the 
transformation of the modalities of knowledge production mentioned above.

CONTEXT:


This proposal outlines prototype strategies for the Federal Agricultural Organization to drive a sustainable transformation in agrifood systems by prioritizing organic farming technologies. The objective is to enhance food security, environmental sustainability, and economic viability while gradually reducing dependence on non-organic agriculture.

---------------------------------------------

Shaping the agri-food system positively requires a shift toward sustainability, equity, and innovation. The following are some prototype ways to achieve this:

Regenerative Agriculture: Focus on farming techniques that restore and enhance soil health, promote biodiversity, and improve water management. This includes practices like crop rotation, agroforestry, and reduced pesticide use. These methods aim to replenish ecosystems rather than deplete them.

Circular Economy Models: Create closed-loop systems where waste from one process is used as input for another. For example, food waste can be turned into compost or bioenergy, while agricultural by-products can be utilized for other industrial purposes.

AgriTech Innovation: Invest in technology such as AI, drones, and IoT for precision farming. This allows farmers to optimize resource use (water, fertilizers) and improve yields while minimizing environmental impacts.

Local Food Systems: Strengthen local food systems by promoting urban farming, farmer’s markets, and short supply chains. This reduces food miles, supports local economies, and enhances food security.

Alternative Protein Sources: Encourage the development of plant-based and lab-grown proteins as more sustainable alternatives to conventional meat production. These innovations can reduce the environmental footprint of food production.

Sustainable Fisheries: Develop and support sustainable fishing practices, including aquaculture innovations, better management of marine ecosystems, and reducing bycatch.

Education and Consumer Awareness: Promote knowledge about sustainable food practices, nutrition, and the environmental impact of food choices. This can shift consumer demand towards more sustainable, ethical options.

Policy Support: Advocate for policy changes that incentivize sustainable farming practices, support local farmers, and address food insecurity. This includes subsidies for sustainable farming, fair trade, and responsible consumption.

Food Waste Reduction: Implement systems to reduce food loss at all stages, from production to consumption. This includes innovations in packaging, storage, and distribution systems that extend shelf life and make use of surplus food.

Inclusive and Fair Trade: Support initiatives that ensure fair wages for farmers, equitable access to land, and resources, as well as opportunities for marginalized groups in the agricultural sector.

These prototypes aim to create a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable agri-food system that balances productivity with environmental and social considerations.

Transforming the national agrifood systems, federal agricultural organizations must prioritize organic farming technologies, ensuring food security, sustainability, and economic viability. These prototype strategies integrate cutting-edge Agri-Tech solutions to scale up organic farming while gradually reducing dependence on conventional, chemical-based agriculture.

Pest Management 
IPM with Precision 
Agriculture 
Alabama Job Sheet No. AL595B 
What is Pest Management? 
Pest management is defined as “utilizing 
environmentally sensitive prevention, avoidance, 
monitoring, and suppression strategies, to manage 
weeds, insects, diseases, animals and other 
organisms that directly or indirectly cause damage or 
annoyance.” Effective pest management relies on the 
use of many tools or strategies to reduce the impacts 
of pests on crops in order to meet landowner 
objectives.. 
Purpose 
Pest management is applied as part of a resource 
management system to support one or more of the 
following purposes: 
• Enhance quantity and quality of crops and 
forages grown for food and fiber. 
• Minimize negative impacts of pest control on soil 
resources, water resources, air resources, plant 
resources, animal resources, and/or humans. 
Integrated Pest Management - IPM 
Agricultural pesticides are potential pollution threats 
to surface and groundwater quality. Integrated pest 
management (IPM) can help protect water quality by 
minimizing the amounts of pesticides that producers 
use and by helping producers to apply pesticides in 
ways that decrease the risk of chemicals washing off 
fields into lakes and rivers or leaching into 
groundwater. This High Intensity IPM practice 
provides an opportunity for the producer to develop 
multiple management strategies that will integrate all 
aspects of pest management within the agricultural 
production system – this is called Integrated Pest 
Management, or IPM. 
The IPM philosophy of pest management involves 
three fundamental steps: 
1. Use cultural methods, biological controls, and 
other alternatives to conventional chemical 
pesticides when practical. 
2. Use field scouting, pest forecasting, and 
economic thresholds to ensure that pesticides 
are only used against real and not perceived 
pest problems. 
3. Match pesticides with field site features so that 
the risk of contaminating water is minimized. 
Substitute lower risk pesticides when feasible, 
and alternate the use of pesticides from different 
chemical classes. 
Practice Specifications 
This practice applies to cropland and hayland. 
Producers eligible for this practice have an identified 
water quality or plant condition concern, and must 
meet all criteria in the Pest Management (595) 
Standard. This includes an environmental risk 
analysis, and implementation of mitigating practices if 
an Intermediate or greater hazard is identified. 
Recommended mitigating or companion practices 
include grassed waterways, filter strips, riparian 
buffers, irrigation water management, residue 
management, or other appropriate practices to fully 
address the water quality concerns. Development 
and implementation of an IPM plan for the major 
pest(s) of concern is required.   When an IPM plan is 
not available through a qualified professional, then 
IPM guidelines will be followed and documented 
using  
Job Sheet No. AL595B - 2 of 5 
IPM principles identified through the Alabama 
Cooperative Extension System (ACES) publications 
http://www.aces.edu/pubs
 .  Evaluation and treatment 
methods will be fully documented and are subject to 
review. 
Non-Chemical Alternatives 
Over-reliance on any single pest control measure can 
have undesirable effects. Pesticides can contribute to 
pest outbreaks by eliminating natural enemies and 
allowing pests to rebound without checks. Cultural 
methods are those good farming practices that make 
the environment less suitable for pest colonization 
and survival. Biological control involves using 
predatory, parasitic, and disease-causing organisms 
for insect pest control as well as using competitive or 
antagonistic organisms for weed suppression. It also 
includes conservation of naturally occurring beneficial 
insects. 
The goal of IPM is to take maximum advantage of 
farming practices that promote plant health (e.g., 
nutrient and irrigation water management) and allow 
crops to escape or tolerate pest injury, and to 
enhance the impact of beneficial insects and other 
natural controls already present. This minimizes the 
need for chemical pesticides to control pests.   At 
least three of these alternative strategies are 
required. These alternatives must be based on crop
pest specific recommendations or other science
based information sources such as ACES. 
Scouting 
A crucial component in any IPM program is to identify 
the pest. The effectiveness of both proactive and 
reactive pest management measures depend on 
correct identification. For this reason, scouts must be 
properly trained.
 Proper monitoring (scouting) can 
determine pest population levels and locations within 
the field and whether infestations are at the 
Economic Threshold, the point where the cost to 
control the pest equals the crop damage caused by 
the pest. Controlling a pest prior to this level is 
therefore not cost effective.   
Field scouting, pest forecasting, and economic 
thresholds will be described in the IPM plan to ensure 
that pesticides are only used against real (not 
perceived) pest problems. Descriptions of pest 
damage and economic thresholds can be found in 
ACES IPM publications. 
On dry cropland and irrigated or non-irrigated 
hayland, frequency of field scouting will be based on 
pest biology.  
Field scouting uses different techniques to classify 
the status of a pest population for decision-making 
purposes. Field scouting procedures are available for 
many of the major pests in Alabama. If no specific 
guidance is available, field sampling should be done 
randomly, with samples taken from across the entire 
field. Take at least 5 samples and preferably 25 – 30 
samples per field. Sweep nets, sticky traps, and 
pheromone traps can be used. Leaf counts are one 
method for recording plant growth stages. Square
foot or larger grids laid out in a field can provide a 
basis for comparative weed counts. 
Pest forecasting uses information or data to predict 
pest problems early. For example, records of 
rainfall and temperature are sometimes used to 
predict the likelihood of disease infections. Regional 
pest monitoring systems can complement scouting.  
In addition, various models have been developed 
which can help determine when scouting should 
begin, or when pesticide application will have the 
maximum control. 
Scouting reports must be kept, along with the 
management decision based on the individual 
scouting report. Decisions to suppress a pest need to 
be based on economic thresholds, when available
 from ACES or other science-based source.
 If no 
threshold is available, then the basis for the decision 
to suppress should be included. For example, “Past 
experience indicates that insect damage beyond this 
point will lead to significant crop yield loss.” All 
decisions made to use a pesticide to suppress an 
insect pest must be made on the basis of a scouting 
report. Where feasible, use lower risk or “Reduced 
Risk” pesticides or reduce use of pesticides through 
spot spraying, seed treatments, etc. 
Job Sheet No. AL595B - 3 of 5 
 
 
Use of Advanced Technologies 
The use of advanced technologies in support of IPM 
practices is required. GPS systems should be used 
for mapping pest infestations based on scouting 
reports. Mapping infestations over time is a good way 
to document scouting activities, and may help in 
predicting pest populations in future years. Some 
scouting activities, such as grid sampling for 
nematodes, will complement advanced technologies 
for pesticide application. GPS in combination with 
Precision Agriculture technologies to reduce the 
amount of pesticide applied (reduced spray overlap 
technology.) is required.  
 
Recordkeeping 
Records are an important tool to track pest 
populations over time, and can document reduction in 
pesticide use. An IPM plan must be developed or 
IPM principles followed and documents provided to 
NRCS. Non-chemical pest management practices 
must be recorded. Documentation shall include target 
pest, method or technique used, date and/or crop 
stage when used. All pesticide use must be recorded. 
Documentation shall include product name or active 
ingredient, application location (field identification), 
target pest, application rate, application timing, and 
extent of application (entire field vs. spot treatment, 
for example).  
 
The attached worksheets will document scouting and 
management decisions, and pesticide use. The 
producer may use blank copies of the worksheets to 
keep annual records, or may use any format for 
record keeping that provides the required information. 
Also, documents similar to the NRCS Idaho 
Checklist/Guidance for Integrated Pest Management 
(http://www.id.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/guidance_ipm.
 html) can be used to assist in the development of an 
IPM plan.

Topic: Integrated Pest Management (IPM)


General Overview
A cornerstone of the Directive is the promotion of IPM, for which general principles are laid down in Annex III to the Directive. Along with the promotion of organic farming, IPM is one of the tools for low-pesticide-input pest management, and IPM must be implemented by all professional users.

IPM involves an integrated approach to the prevention and/or suppression of organisms harmful to plants through the use of all available information, tools and methods
IPM aims to keep the use of pesticides and other forms of intervention only to levels that are economically and ecologically justified and which reduce or minimise risk to human health and the environment.
Sustainable biological, physical and other non-chemical methods must be preferred to chemical methods if they provide satisfactory pest control.
Definition
Integrated pest management means careful consideration of all available plant protection methods and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of populations of harmful organisms and keep the use of plant protection products and other forms of intervention to levels that are economically and ecologically justified and reduce or minimise risks to human health and the environment. 'Integrated pest management' emphasises the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms.

Principles
The prevention and/or suppression of harmful organisms should be achieved or supported among other options especially by:
crop rotation,
use of adequate cultivation techniques (e.g. stale seedbed technique, sowing dates and densities, under-sowing, conservation tillage, pruning and direct sowing),
use, where appropriate, of resistant/tolerant cultivars and standard/certified seed and planting material,
use of balanced fertilisation, liming and irrigation/drainage practices,
preventing the spreading of harmful organisms by hygiene measures (e.g. by regular cleansing of machinery and equipment),
protection and enhancement of important beneficial organisms, e.g. by adequate plant protection measures or the utilisation of ecological infrastructures inside and outside production sites.
Harmful organisms must be monitored by adequate methods and tools, where available. Such adequate tools should include observations in the field as well as scientifically sound warning, forecasting and early diagnosis systems, where feasible, as well as the use of advice from professionally qualified advisors.
Based on the results of the monitoring the professional user has to decide whether and when to apply plant protection measures. Robust and scientifically sound threshold values are essential components for decision making. For harmful organisms threshold levels defined for the region, specific areas, crops and particular climatic conditions must be taken into account before treatments, where feasible.
Sustainable biological, physical and other non-chemical methods must be preferred to chemical methods if they provide satisfactory pest control.
The pesticides applied shall be as specific as possible for the target and shall have the least side effects on human health, non-target organisms and the environment.
The professional user should keep the use of pesticides and other forms of intervention to levels that are necessary, e.g. by reduced doses, reduced application frequency or partial applications, considering that the level of risk in vegetation is acceptable and they do not increase the risk for development of resistance in populations of harmful organisms.
Where the risk of resistance against a plant protection measure is known and where the level of harmful organisms requires repeated application of pesticides to the crops, available anti-resistance strategies should be applied to maintain the effectiveness of the products. This may include the use of multiple pesticides with different modes of action.
Based on the records on the use of pesticides and on the monitoring of harmful organisms the professional user should check the success of the applied plant protection measures.

topic:  Syngenta Seedcare introduces EQUENTO®, offering a novel mode of action to control soil pests



Novel seed treatment brings next-level sustainability in pest control while promoting healthy plant establishment

Contains best-in-class PLINAZOLIN® technology

Basel / Switzerland, 5 June 2023 – Syngenta Crop Protection’s Seedcare business today introduces EQUENTO®, a novel seed treatment that provides outstanding control of various soil pests while helping farmers increase the sustainability of their farming operations.

EQUENTO®, based on Syngenta’s cutting-edge PLINAZOLIN® technology, is applied onto seeds, protecting the crop right from the start of its life. Based on a new mode of action (IRAC Group 30), it breaks the critical rise in insect resistance, while offering precise control of a broad variety of soil pests – including difficult-to-control pests such as the wireworm and the red legged earth mite. The seed treatment can be applied across multiple crops including cereals and canola.

Among the key benefits EQUENTO® brings is its ability to increase the sustainability of a farm’s operations. Safe for both the seed and plant, this seed treatment is highly effective at very low dose rates and is not easily soluble or mobile in soil. This provides precise and effective pest control in the area immediately surrounding a plant’s roots and ensures healthier roots that contribute to better soil health and biodiversity.

This innovative seed treatment also offers farmers greater flexibility in farming decisions – ranging from application timings, dose rates to choices of mixtures with other insecticides and fungicides. It is effective even in low soil temperatures, controlling pests that either ingest or come in contact with the plant, and reducing pest populations in the soil. In addition, EQUENTO® features exceptional target specificity, which enables farmers to precisely tailor their dose rates to meet particular pest challenges.

“EQUENTO®'s combination of a novel mode of action, broad spectrum pest control, as well as superior seed and crop safety reflects Syngenta's commitment to innovation,” said Jonathan Brown, Global Head of Syngenta Seedcare. “It transforms the ability of farmers to manage wireworms and other hard to control pests, establish a healthy young crop crucial for good yields, while protecting soil health, bio-diversity and the planet.”

Insects and soil pests pose significant challenges to farmers, threatening both yields as well as the quality of the harvests by harming the crop as well as opening pathways for disease. Their ability to constantly evolve, coupled with the impact of climate change that has propelled shifts in the insect pressure and spectrum farmers face, have increased the urgency for innovative solutions that protect the farmers ability to grow productively and sustainably. An estimated 600 species of insects are already deemed resistant to at least one insecticide.  

Syngenta will mark its global launch of EQUENTO® in Australia later this year, under the trademark EQUENTO® Extreme. Further registrations are expected to follow in other markets worldwide.

Pheromone Pest Control Solutions


Using our pheromones in agriculture equips growers with a radically different and highly sustainable form of insect control, helping optimize crop yield by disrupting insects' mating patterns; and at the same time, helping preserve biodiversity and ecosystem balance. 

Overview: Pheromones
At BASF, we are always asking “Is there a more sustainable way to provide insect control?” With damaging Lepidoptera (moth) species, the answer is to use the insect’s own natural pheromones against them. With a non-toxic target mode of action, pheromones are a unique way of approaching insect control via mating disruption. Pheromones provide growers with a highly-sustainable approach to protect pome fruit, grapes and stone fruits. Instead of interfering with the pest’s biochemistry, pheromones work by disrupting the pest’s ability to mate, limiting larvae from inhabiting and destroying a crop. 

Key Features and Benefits of Pheromones
A grower with pruning shears cuts green grapes from a vine.
Features
Unique activity
Zero residue product
Excellent toxicological and environmental profile
Very low use rates
Benefits
Well-suited for integrated pest management (IPM) and insecticide resistance management programs
Ideal for use in organic fruit production
Species specific action works on the pests you need to control
 
No significant acute toxicity to mammals
Safe to use around beneficial insects and non-target species
Developing resistance is unlikely as it is natural to the insect’s mating process
Mode of Action
Pheromones work differently than other insecticides. Instead of disrupting the pest’s biochemistry, pheromones work by disrupting the natural mating cycle of pests. Sex pheromones are chemicals released by female insects into the air to attract male insects during mating season. BASF uses a certain group of pheromones called straight-chain lepidopteran pheromones, which are identical to those produced naturally by female insects. These artificial pheromones are released in very small quantities into a field or orchard and produce a “cloud” of pheromones. This cloud disorients the male insect enough that he cannot find the female insect’s trail of pheromones to mate and reproduce. As a result, pest infestations can be prevented or significantly reduced.

Because these straight-chain lepidopteran pheromones are identical to those naturally produced, it is highly unlikely that insect resistance will develop.

for the male insect to locate female insects for mating, thus limiting 
the opportunity for larvae to inhabit and destroy crops. This approach 
to pest control is commonly known as mating disruption. 
Pheromones are an optimal tool for both pest management and resistance management 
programs. Pheromones are applied using dispensers that time-release the product to form 
a pheromone cloud. The cloud is non-toxic and leaves zero-residue, making it ideal for

 An integrated hook is molded into the dispensers. The design of the hook enables 
one worker to hang roughly 500 dispensers per hour. With an intended usage of 500 
dispensers/hectare, one worker should be able to treat 1 hectare/hour (2.5 acres/hour).

levels evident during a naturally occurring insect infestation. Theoretical calculations of 
pheromones released during an infestation ranges from 10 mg/ha/hr to 227.5 mg/ha/hr. In

Mode of Action 
Sex pheromones are chemical substances emitted by female insects and released through 
the air to attract males during the mating season. 
Certain chemicals form a group known as the straight-chain lepidopteran pheromones used 
Lepidoptera. Their chemical structure is identical 
to the compounds naturaly produced by female insects. Typically contained in sealed 
dispensers, these pheromones are constantly dispersed in minute quantities throughout the 
crop area, producing an invisible pheromone “cloud.” 
These clouds contain enough pheromones to disorient the males. No longer able to locate 
the pheromone trail emitted by females, the insects are unable to mate and reproduce.  
Resistance Management
 Because straight-chain lepidopteran pheromones are identical to sex pheromones 
produced by female insects and integral to the mating process, the likelihood that these 
insects will develop resistance to pheromones is very low. 
Accordingly, pheromones are ideal components of integrated pest management and 
resistance management programs.

I and their use to control arthropod, plant nematode, helminth, and protozoan 
pests (col. 1, ll. 19-22; col. 15, ll. 42-48). 
5 
Appeal 2011-005039 
Reexamination Control 90/008,317 
Patent 5,700,460 
2. Among a list of 236 specifically identified N-phenylpyrazole 
derivatives is 5-amino-3-cyano-1-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-4
 trifluoromethylsulphinylpyrazole (col. 6, ll. 17-18; compound 52), also 
known as fipronil. 
3. Hatton discloses that the N-phenylpyrazole compounds can be 
used to control Periplanta spp., Periplanta americana; Blatella spp., 
cockroaches, ants, etc. (col. 15, l. 56 to col. 17, l. 34, especially col. 15, l. 68 
to col. 16, l. 1; col. 16, l. 23; col. 33, l. 55). 
4. Hatton teaches that the compounds can be used “in the control of 
cockroaches, ants and termites and similar arthropod pests in infested 
domestic and industrial premises” (col. 16, ll. 23-25). 
5. Hatton discloses that the compounds can be applied in various 
forms (col. 19, ll. 19-20), including as a solid or liquid to soil (col. 17, l. 65
 66); in solid or liquid baits (col. 20, ll. 19-23); and in granules, pellets, 
briquettes, or capsules (col. 20, ll. 32-35).

as a wettable powder (col. 24, Example 3), as an emusifiable suspension 
(col. 24, Example 5), as water-dispersible granules (col. 24-25; Example 6), 
as a dusting powder (col. 25; Example 7), and as an edible bait comprising 
wheat flour and molasses (col. 25; Example 8).

8. Hatton teaches that the compounds of formula I “are of value in 
controlling pests which feed on parts of the plant remote from the point of 
application, e.g., leaf feeding insects are killed by the subject compounds 
applied to roots.” (Col. 18, ll. 3-7.) 
9. Hatton teaches that “[i]n addition the compounds may reduce 
attacks on the plant by means of antifeeding or repellant effects.”  (Col. 18, 
ll. 8-9.) 
Colliot 
10. Colliot teaches that the “insecticidal properties of fipronil were 
discovered . . . in 1987” (p. 29). 
11. “Fipronil is a highly effective insecticide against both piercing
sucking and chewing insects, and can be effectively delivered via soil, foliar, 
bait, or seed treatment application.” (Id.) 
12. Colliot describes application of fipronil to the soil (p. 32). 
DISCUSSION 
It is undisputed that fipronil, the compound recited in all of the 
rejected claims, was a known insecticide (FF1, FF2, FF10, & F11).  
Appellant asserts to have discovered that fipronil is also an insect attractant, 
a compound which attracts insects from a distance (Appeal Brief (“App. 
Br.”) 9, dated August 17, 2010).  To reflect this discovery, Appellant 
claimed methods for “attracting insects” and “attracting and killing insects” 
comprising “offering” fipronil to said insects for ingestion (id. at 18, VIII. 
Claims Appendix; claims 1 & 15).  Appellant asserts that the claimed 
7 
Appeal 2011-005039 
Reexamination Control 90/008,317 
Patent 5,700,460 
methods are patentable over the cited prior art publications3 because the 
publications do not describe fipronil as an insect attractant nor use it as one.  
Thus, the issue in this proceeding is whether the claimed preamble of a 
“method for attracting” insects and the claimed step of “offering” fipronil to 
insects “for ingestion” distinguish the claims from the known uses of fipronil 
as an insecticide. 
It is hornbook patent law that merely recognizing something that was 
not known before is insufficient to render an old process again patentable.  
In re Cruciferous Sprout Litig., 301 F.3d 1343, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2002). See 
also In re Woodruff, 919 F.2d 1575, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990); In re 
Omeprazole Patent Litig., 483 F.3d 1364, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 
[A] prior art reference may anticipate when the claim limitation 
or limitations not expressly found in that reference are 
nonetheless inherent to it. . . . Inherency is not necessarily 
coterminous with the knowledge of those of ordinary skill in 
the art. Artisans of ordinary skill may not recognize the 
inherent characteristics or functioning of the prior art. 
MEHL/Biophile Int’l Corp. v. Milgraum, 192 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 
1999). 
In MEHL, the patentee claimed a “method of hair depilation” utilizing 
steps which had been described in a prior art publication.  The prior art 
method did not perform the steps for the purpose of hair depilation, but it 
was determined that hair depilation would have been a necessary, albeit 
unrecognized and inherent, consequence of carrying out the steps.  Id. at 
1366. Although the claim preamble expressly required the method to be 
performed for the purpose of hair depilation, the court did not find it 
3 Hatton and Colliot. 
8 
Appeal 2011-005039 
Reexamination Control 90/008,317 
Patent 5,700,460 
necessary that the publication’s authors “appreciate[d] the results” of their 
process to constitute an anticipation of the claimed process (id.). Thus, the 
purpose for which the method was accomplished was insufficient to 
distinguish it from the prior art. 
 Similarly, in Perricone v. Medicis Pharm. Corp., 432 F.3d 1368, 
1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2005), a method claim preamble, which required 
“preventing sunburn damage to exposed skin surfaces,” was found satisfied 
by a prior art process which applied the same composition as claimed to 
exposed skin surfaces, but for a different purpose.  “[T]he new realization 
alone [that the old composition would prevent sunburn damage] does not 
render the old invention patentable.”  Perricone at 1377. 
Claims 1 and 15 stand on the same ground.  Both Hatton and Colliot 
describe providing fipronil to insects in the conventional forms in which 
insecticides are used. For example, Hatton described applying its N
 phenylpyrazole compounds, of which fipronil is specifically identified, to 
soil in solid and liquid forms, and describes concentrates, powders, and 
granules (FF2, FF5, FF6, & FF7). Colliot also teaches various conventional 
applications, including applying fipronil to the soil (FF11 & FF12).  While 
neither Hatton nor Colliot discloses that fipronil would attract insects when 
present in the soil or at other locations (FF8 & FF11), the attractant 
properties are inherent to fipronil and thus would necessarily occur.  See In 
re Papesch, 315 F.2d 381, 391 (CCPA 1963) (“From the standpoint of 
patent law, a compound and all of its properties are inseparable; they are one 
and the same thing.”). The fact that Appellant discovered that fipronil 
attracts insects does not distinguish the claimed method from the prior art 
9 
Appeal 2011-005039 
Reexamination Control 90/008,317 
Patent 5,700,460 
because once fipronil was applied to the soil, plant part, etc., it would attract 
insects, regardless of whether the method was carried out for this purpose or 
whether the attractant result was recognized.  Mere appreciation of a 
necessary result of a known process does not impart patentability to that 
process. 
The methods also comprise the step of “offering” fipronil to insects 
“for ingestion.” We interpret this step to mean that fipronil is presented to 
the insects in such a way or form that it would be ingested by them.  
Appellant has not provided sufficient evidence that a narrower or different 
interpretation is warranted. Providing fipronil on soil or on plants, or to any 
other location described in the Hatton and Colliot publications (FF5, FF8, & 
FF11, FF12), would leave fipronil accessible to the insect for ingestion and 
thus meet the claimed requirement of offering fipronil for ingestion.  
Appellant has not articulated a difference between “offering” fipronil for 
ingestion, as recited in the claims, and applying fipronil to the soil or a plant 
in a solid or liquid form as taught by the cited Hatton and Colliot 
publications. 
In sum, while the claimed purpose of attracting insects with fipronil 
was not described in either Hatton or Colliot, the latter publications describe 
the same compound, the same method steps, and therefore the result of 
attracting insects would have inherently been accomplished – anticipating 
the claimed subject matter. 
Referring to Example 8 of Hatton, Appellant argues that fipronil 
would not attract insects because its attractant properties would be 
overwhelmed or drowned out by the molasses with which it was combined 
10 
Appeal 2011-005039 
Reexamination Control 90/008,317 
Patent 5,700,460 
(App. Br. 9-10). Therefore, Appellant contends the claimed method of 
attracting insects “is not a ‘natural result flowing from’ any of the methods 
disclosed by Hatton.” (Id. at 9.) 
This argument ignores Hatton’s teaching that its compounds can be 
utilized in solid and liquid forms which do not involve baits comprising 
molasses (FF5, FF7, & FF8).  The same can be said of Colliot which 
describes baits, but also other fipronil forms (FF11 & FF12).  Thus, even 
were it true that the bait components would somehow mask fipronil’s 
attractant properties, there is disclosure in each of Hatton and Colliot of non
bait fipronil forms in which fipronil is not associated with molasses or 
another food ingredient. 
Appellant attempts to distinguish Hatton from the claimed method 
because Hatton discloses that “the compounds may reduce attacks on the 
plant by means of antifeeding or repellant effects.”  (FF9.)  This argument is 
not persuasive.  While Hatton may have believed that its compounds 
repelled insects, such belief does not change the fact that, when fipronil is 
applied to the soil, a plant, etc., as taught in the Hatton and Colliot 
publications, it would inherently have attracted insects, even if such a result 
was unappreciated and unrecognized.  As mentioned above, appreciation of 
a result is not required to establish inherent anticipation. 
Appellant contends that insects would not ingest fipronil.  However, 
because the prior art teaches applying the same compound to soil and on 
plants, the Examiner had a reasonable basis to believe that it would be 
ingested. Appellant has not provided sufficient evidence that ingestion 
would not occur.

Appeal 2011-005039 
Reexamination Control 90/008,317 
Patent 5,700,460 
Appellant contends that Jansen v. Rexall Sundown, Inc., 342 F.3d 
1329 (Fed. Cir. 2003) demands a different result (Reply Brief (“Reply Br.”) 
8, dated January 21, 2011). 
The preambles “for attracting insects” and “for attracting and 
killing insects” set forth the objective of the method, and the 
body of each claim directs that the method be performed on 
“said insects.” The recitation of “said insects” In [sic] both 
claims 1 and 15 gives life and meaning to the preambles' 
statement of purpose. 
In Jansen, the claims were directed to methods of treating or 
preventing macrocytic-megaloblastic anemia comprising administering 
effective amounts of folic acid and vitamin B12 “to a human in need 
thereof.” Jansen at 1333. The Federal Circuit stated that the claim must be 
interpreted to require the method be practiced with the intent to achieve the 
objective stated in the preamble. Id. “The preamble is therefore not merely 
a statement of effect that may or may not be desired or appreciated.  Rather, 
it is a statement of the intentional purpose for which the method must be 
performed.”  Id. 
The reason why Jansen does not require a different result has already 
been addressed in Ex parte Batteux, Appeal No. 2007-0622, 2007 WL 
5211675 (BPAI, Mar. 27, 2007, Informative Opinion).   
Jansen was an infringement case, requiring the court to 
construe the subject claim “so as to sustain [its] validity, if 
possible.” Whittaker Corp. v. UNR Indus., 911 F.2d 709,712, 15 
USPQ2d 1742, 1743 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (citing ACS Hosp. Sys., 
Inc. v. Montefiore Hosp., 732 F.2d 1572, 1577, 221 USPQ 929, 
932 (Fed. Cir. 1984).  In contrast, during prosecution, a claim 
must be given its broadest reasonable interpretation.  Unlike the 
case here, in Jansen, the patentee was arguing a broad 
construction to establish infringement. 342 F.3d at 1331, 68 
12 
Appeal 2011-005039 
Reexamination Control 90/008,317 
Patent 5,700,460 
USPQ2d at 1156. However, the court “strictly construed” the 
claim against the inventor, in view of statements made during 
prosecution. Id. at 1334, 68 USPQ2d at 1158. 
Batteux, 2007 WL 5211675 at *5. 
The “terms appearing in a [claim] preamble may be deemed 
limitations of a claim when they give meaning to the claim and properly 
define the invention.” In re Paulsen, 30 F.3d 1475, 1479 (Fed. Cir. 1994). 
“Conversely, where a patentee defines a structurally complete invention in 
the claim body and uses the preamble only to state a purpose or intended use 
for the invention, the preamble is not a claim limitation.”  Rowe v. Dror, 112 
F.3d 473, 478 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  In other words, a claim preamble is to be 
treated as a necessary claim limitation when it imparts some structure or 
other feature to the claimed invention.  Thus, in Rowe v. Dror, a claim to a 
“balloon angioplasty catheter” was interpreted in view of the application 
specification to mean a catheter that could be “inflated radially outward to 
dilate a narrowed region in a blood vessel,” distinguishing it from the more 
general class of balloon catheters. Id. at 479-80. The phrase “balloon 
angioplasty catheter” breathed “life, meaning, and vitality” into the claim 
because it accrued structural features to the catheter, in addition to those 
recited in the body of the claim, that enabled it to be used in the context of 
an angioplasty procedure. In this case, Appellant has not established that the 
“attracting” feature of the claim adds a structure or step which distinguishes 
the claim from the identical compound and identical method steps described 
in the Hatton and Colliot publications. 
13 
Appeal 2011-005039 
Reexamination Control 90/008,317 
Patent 5,700,460 
Claims 3, 7, 9, 20, and 22 
Appellant also contends that the ‘460 patent shows the “unexpected 
result that fipronil acts as an attractant for cockroaches, which are well
known as insects that are able to enter or inhabit buildings.”  (App. Br. 11.) 
Appellant states that “Hatton does not suggest or disclose, either expressly 
of inherently, using fipronil to attract insects which are enable to enter or 
inhabit buildings.” (Id.) 
Claim 3 is drawn to the method of claim 1 where the insects “are 
insects which are able to enter or habit buildings.”  Hatton teaches that the 
compounds can be used “in the control of cockroaches, ant and termites and 
similar arthropod pests in infested domestic and industrial premises” (col. 
16, ll. 23-25; FF4). When fipronil is used in such a context, in one of its 
conventional liquid or solid forms, the fipronil would inherently attract the 
insects. 
As to the assertion of “unexpected results,” we note that the latter is a 
secondary consideration available to rebut obviousness under Section 103, 
but not anticipation under Section 102, the rejections at issue in this appeal. 
Claim 24 
Claim 24 is drawn to the method of claim 15, where the fipronil “is 
offered with a carrier or surface-active agent.”  Appellant contends that 
Hatton describes the diluent or carrier with a food substance to induce 
consumption by an arthropod (App. Br. 11-12). 
14 
Appeal 2011-005039 
Reexamination Control 90/008,317 
Patent 5,700,460 
To the contrary, Hatton describes various examples in which fipronil 
is combined with carriers in non-bait forms (FF5 & FF7).  Appellant’s 
argument is not supported by the evidence. 
None of the Examples in Hatton Contains Fipronil 
Appellant contends Hatton discloses 236 compounds, only one of 
which is fipronil, and that none of the specific examples described in Hatton 
contains fipronil (Reply Br. 4).  Appellant argues that the Examiner may not 
pick and choose among various teachings from a cited reference, but rather 
the reference must described the claimed invention as arranged in the claim 
(id. at 4-5). 
Here, fipronil is specifically described in Hatton, albeit in a list of 236 
compounds (FF2).  However, the length of the list does not negate the 
express disclosure by Hatton of fipronil.  A species which is specifically 
disclosed in a prior art reference is anticipatory even though it appears 
“without special emphasis in a longer list.”  Perricone, 432 F.3d at 1376. 
There does not appear to be a specific example in Hatton of a 
formulation comprising fipronil.  However, specific examples of the claimed 
subject matter are not necessary to establish anticipation.  Rather, to 
anticipate, one skilled in the art must be able to “at once envisage” the 
claimed subject matter in the prior art disclosure. In re Petering, 301 F.2d 
676, 681 (CCPA 1962). 
In this case, Hatton has broad disclosure of utilizing a formula I 
compound to control arthropods (which includes insects) and provided a list 
of different formulations, all of which appear to be simply conventional 
15 
Appeal 2011-005039 
Reexamination Control 90/008,317 
Patent 5,700,460 
forms in which insecticides are used to control pests (FF1 & FF3-FF7).  
Persons of ordinary skill in the art would have immediately recognized that 
fipronil, which is expressly disclosed in Hatton, can be used in any of these 
forms, including non-bait forms.  Appellant has not introduced sufficient 
evidence that Hatton’s disclosure would be read more restrictively.  
Appellant contends that “picking and choosing” would be necessary to 
arrive at the claimed invention, but fipronil is expressly disclosed and thus 
the skilled worker would be led directly to it.  Its ability to attract insects is 
an inherent property that would necessarily result from using it.  All that 
remains is for the person of ordinary skill in the art to envisage it applied in 
any one of the conventional forms disclosed in Hatton, the latter which is 
expressly taught by Hatton (FF1, FF4, & FF5).  
Kukorowski Declaration 
Appellant cited a declaration by Dr. Kenneth A. Kukorowski, an 
author of the Colliot publication, who stated that fipronil was being 
researched in Colliot as a bait formulation and would not have attracted 
insects (¶ 6). This testimony ignores express disclosure in Colliot that 
fipronil “can be effectively delivered via soil.”  Colliot did not limit fipronil 
to the bait formulation, but expressly disclosed other applications (see, e.g., 
F11).
